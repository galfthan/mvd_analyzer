// ObituaryPattern is one death-print marker. KTX's obituaries always
// follow the form "<victim> <marker> [<killer suffix>]" — `Marker` is
// the substring that identifies the obit kind; `Weapon` is the
// canonical short code for downstream attribution (rl, lg, sg, …, plus
// the synthetic "suicide", "water", "lava", "world", "fall", "squish",
// "teamkill"); `Suicide` and `TeamKill` flag the variants the
// FragAnalyzer needs to bucket separately.
//
// The list below is the single source of truth for victim-prefix
// obituaries. Both this parser (to fire DeathEvent via maybeEmitDeath
// when neither STAT_HEALTH nor DF_DEAD caught the transition) and the
// FragAnalyzer downstream walk the same table — keeping them aligned
// removes the silent drift risk of two parallel copies.
//
// Pattern order matters: more specific patterns precede their generic
// supersets so the more informative attribution wins (e.g. " was
// telefragged by his teammate" must be checked before " was telefragged
// by "). The composite slice ObituaryVictimPatterns is the
// canonically-ordered list a caller iterates left-to-right.
