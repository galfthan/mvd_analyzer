# mvd-reader

Layer 1 of the mvd-analyzer workspace: turn QuakeWorld demo data — today an
MVD file, tomorrow a QTV stream — into a canonical event stream that
analytics can consume without caring about the on-the-wire format.

## What's in the box

- `events/` — the **public API**. Defines the `Source` iterator interface,
  every concrete `Event` type, and the source-agnostic domain types carried
  on those events (`ServerData`, `PlayerInfo`). Import this package and
  nothing else if you're writing downstream analytics.
- `mvd/` — MVD wire-format decoder: message headers, svc_* command opcodes,
  FTE and MVD protocol extensions, hidden-message framing.
- `parser/` — message → event translation. Takes `mvd.DemoMessage`s and
  emits the concrete event types from `events/`.
- `mvdfile/` — gzip-aware file reader. Detects `.mvd.gz` by magic bytes and
  wraps the stream.
- `source/mvd/` — the reference **Source implementation** backed by an MVD
  file or in-memory byte stream. Exposes `Open(path)` and
  `NewFromReader(io.Reader)`; both return a value that satisfies
  `events.Source`.

## Using mvd-reader

```go
import (
    "io"

    "github.com/mvd-analyzer/mvd-reader/events"
    mvdsource "github.com/mvd-analyzer/mvd-reader/source/mvd"
)

src, err := mvdsource.Open("demo.mvd.gz")
if err != nil { panic(err) }
defer src.Close()

for {
    ev, err := src.Next()
    if err == io.EOF { break }
    if err != nil { panic(err) }

    switch e := ev.(type) {
    case *events.ServerDataEvent:
        // ...
    case *events.FragUpdateEvent:
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Event time.** Every event carries the demo-clock timestamp as
`TimeMs int32` (integer milliseconds), exposed on the `Event` interface
as `EventTimeMs() int32`. That is the canonical unit the whole pipeline
consumes — no event struct holds float seconds. `EventTime() float64`
and the `events.Sec(ms)` helper are presentation twins
(`float64(TimeMs)*0.001`) for logs / human-readable tooling only. The
one wire-native float-seconds time is `ServerData.ServerTime`
(id1 `svc_serverdata`, on `ServerDataEvent.Data`), kept as-is because
that is how the protocol carries it.

The concrete event list, in stable order:

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ServerDataEvent` | Connection-time server data block |
| `UserInfoEvent` | Player slot userinfo bind / rebind. `Vacated` flags the empty-string form the server broadcasts when it drops a client (see [MVD_FORMAT.md](MVD_FORMAT.md), "Departure"). |
| `PrintEvent` | Text messages (chat, obituaries, system) |
| `StatUpdateEvent` | Per-player stat delta (health, armor, weapons, ...) |
| `FragUpdateEvent` | Frag count changes (server-authoritative) |
| `PlayerPositionEvent` | Per-player position / angle sample |
| `DamageEvent` | Damage dealt (from KTX hidden messages) |
| `DemoInfoEvent` | KTX `*demoinfo` JSON dump |
| `IntermissionEvent` | Scoreboard-camera takeover (match ended) |
| `StuffTextEvent` | Server-pushed console command |
| `CenterPrintEvent` | HUD center text (match settings countdown) |
| `ServerInfoEvent` | Mid-game serverinfo key/value update |
| `DeathEvent` | Player died — deduplicated across `StatHealth` edges, the `DF_DEAD` playerinfo bit, and obituary corroboration |
| `SpawnEvent` | Player spawned — deduplicated across `StatHealth` edges and the `DF_DEAD` playerinfo bit clearing |
| `ItemSpawnEvent` | Item entity observed — baseline known (kind, position) |
| `ItemStateEvent` | Item became taken or respawned — from entity modelindex transitions |
| `BackpackDropHintEvent` | KTX `//ktx drop` stuffcmd: `(BackpackEnt, ItemFlags, PlayerEnt)` for RL/LG drops only |
| `ItemPickupHintEvent` | KTX `//ktx took` stuffcmd: `(ItemEnt, RespawnSec, PlayerEnt)` — authoritative pickup attribution for every MH / armor / weapon / powerup touch |
| `BackpackPickupHintEvent` | KTX `//ktx bp` stuffcmd: `(BackpackEnt, PlayerEnt)` — symmetric to `//ktx drop`, fires only for RL/LG packs |
| `DemoMarkEvent` | KTX `//demomark[ <args>]` stufftext: `(PlayerSlot, Label)` — player-inserted bookmark. Slot is the dem_single block target (the only attribution channel), -1 if not slot-addressed; `Label` is the optional HoonyMode argument tail. Fires even out of match; not deduped |
| `ItemPickupPrintEvent` | Per-client `svc_print` "You got the X" / "You receive N health" — covers ammo boxes and H15/H25 that `//ktx took` misses. **Subject to per-client `msg` cvar filter; frequently absent in competitive demos.** |
| `DemoStartTimestampEvent` | mvdhidden `0x000B`: wall-clock (Unix epoch ms, ULEB128) at demo open — anchor for syncing the demo to real time |
| `PausedDurationEvent` | mvdhidden `0x000A`: real wall-clock ms for one paused idle frame. One per frame while paused (clock frozen); sum a run for the pause length. Note the non-standard, length-header-less framing — see [MVD_FORMAT.md](MVD_FORMAT.md#hidden-message-types) |
| `MoverSpawnEvent` | Inline brush-model ("*N") entity observed — lift/door/train identity: entnum, BSP submodel index, baseline origin |
| `MoverStateEvent` | Mover wire-state change — origin moved (per frame while travelling) or visibility flipped. Hold-last between events is the exact pose |
| `SoundEvent` | `svc_sound` — a sound started on an entity's channel: emitting entity (`Ent`), channel (`CHAN_WEAPON`=1 for weapon fire), resolved precache `Name`, and origin. Weapon-fire sounds are the truthful per-shot signal consumed by the `shots` analyzer |
| `ProjectileSpawnEvent` | A rocket (`progs/missile.mdl`) or grenade (`progs/grenade.mdl`) entity first observed — kind + muzzle origin. The entnum brackets the flight; the `shots` analyzer attributes it to the same-frame RL/GL fire |
| `ProjectileDespawnEvent` | A tracked projectile left the wire (impact / timeout) — last origin. Co-locates with the explosion + `mvdhidden_dmgdone` damage, so the launching shot links to that impact |
| `BeamEvent` | `svc_temp_entity` lightning beam (`TE_LIGHTNING1/2/3`) — firing entity + start/end coords. `TE_LIGHTNING2` is the player LG bolt (one per fire tick), the authoritative per-shot LG signal for the `shots` analyzer |
| `NailsFrameEvent` | `svc_nails` / `svc_nails2` — the full live nail set for one frame (ids + origins). Emitted only when nail decoding is enabled (`Parser.SetDecodeNails`); high volume, off by default. Note most modern servers (`sv_nailhack`) send nails as packet entities (spike models) instead, so this fires only on non-nailhack servers |

`DeathEvent` and `SpawnEvent` are derived events the parser synthesises
from up to three sources sharing one per-player dead-state cursor, so a
transition is captured even when an individual protocol signal misses it:

1. **`StatHealth` edges** in `dem_stats` (>0 → ≤0 for death, ≤0 → >0 for
   spawn) — reliable for the player whose stat block is being consumed,
   but structurally blind to transitions whose stat update is addressed
   to a different player.
2. **The `DF_DEAD` bit** in `svc_playerinfo`, broadcast every frame for
   every player, catching the deaths the stat detector misses. The first
   two are deduplicated in `maybeEmitDeath` / `maybeEmitSpawn`.
3. **Obituary corroboration** (`forceEmitDeath`, driven by the parser's
   obituary-print path, gated on match start): force-emits a death when
   KTX broadcasts an obit whose entity-state transition never reaches the
   wire — tight respawn cycles and the pent-deflection corner case. This
   is the only source that bypasses the dedup, since KTX's scoreboard is
   authoritative that a death happened. (`DeathEvent` only; the paired
   `SpawnEvent` still arrives via the normal `DF_DEAD`-clear path.)

They fire at the exact event time, so analytics don't have to reconstruct
death/spawn by comparing health samples across the sampling boundary
(including the instant-respawn case where a gib and respawn land in the
same 50 ms window). See `parser/stats.go` and `parser/print.go` for the
emission logic. The canonical obituary marker→classification table lives
here in the parser (`parser/obituary.go`, `ObituaryPatterns`); this layer
projects its victim-prefix subset (`FindObituaryVictim`) to recover the
dying player's name, while the analyzer layer builds its full killer /
weapon attribution matchers from that same table (KTX-mod-specific text
parsing, not a protocol signal — so the derivation logic stays in
mvd-analytics, but there is now a single shared table, not two drifting
copies).

`ItemSpawnEvent` and `ItemStateEvent` are derived events synthesised
from the entity-state stream (`svc_spawnbaseline`,
`svc_packetentities`, `svc_deltapacketentities` — see
`parser/entities.go`). `ItemSpawnEvent` fires once per item entity
when the demo first makes it observable, carrying the classified kind
(`ra`, `mh`, `rl`, ...) and world origin. `ItemStateEvent` fires on
every visibility transition: `Taken=true` when the entity's
modelindex drops to 0 (server set `self->model = ""` on pickup),
`Taken=false` when it reappears (`SUB_regen` restored the model).
Classification uses standard Quake 1 item model paths (armor.mdl +
skin for GA/YA/RA; maps/b_bh*.bsp for health; progs/g_*.mdl for
weapons; progs/{quaddama,invulner,invisibl}.mdl for powerups) —
protocol-level, not KTX-specific.

`MoverSpawnEvent` and `MoverStateEvent` are synthesised from the same
entity-state stream for inline brush-model entities — entities whose
model is a `"*N"` submodel of the map BSP (func_plat, func_door,
func_train, func_button, func_wall, func_illusionary). Triggers never
appear: Quake progs `InitTrigger` clears their model, and mvdsv only
writes entities with a non-zero modelindex (`sv_ents.c:790`).
`MoverSpawnEvent` fires once per entity with its submodel index and
baseline origin; `MoverStateEvent` fires on every origin change
(per frame while a lift/door travels) and visibility flip. Because
MVD deltas only re-send a changed origin, holding the last event's
origin between events reproduces the entity's motion exactly — this
is the demo-side input for posing submodel collision hulls the way
the client does in `CL_SetSolidEntities` (ezquake `cl_ents.c`).

`svc_playerinfo` uses the same delta-compression pattern for player view
angles: omitted pitch/yaw/roll components inherit the last value seen for
that player. `PlayerPositionEvent.Angles` therefore exposes the current
full view-angle state per emitted position sample, not just the sparse
angle fields present in that packet.

`ItemPickupHintEvent` and `BackpackPickupHintEvent` are the
authoritative KTX counterparts to `ItemStateEvent`: they pin each
pickup to a concrete player edict, replacing the nearest-origin
heuristic that `ItemStateEvent` alone requires for attribution.
`//ktx took` (`ktx/src/items.c:355, 541, 1048, 2074, 2083`) fires on
every competitive item touch; `//ktx bp`
(`ktx/src/items.c:2471`) fires on every RL/LG backpack pickup —
symmetric to the existing `//ktx drop` hint. Both are
**KTX-specific**: a non-KTX server (ktpro, CustomTF, or vanilla)
will not emit them, in which case consumers fall back to
`ItemStateEvent` + heuristics or to per-player stats deltas.

`ItemPickupPrintEvent` complements the hints by parsing KTX's
per-client pickup prints (`"You got the Red Armor"`,
`"You receive 25 health"`). It covers categories `//ktx took`
misses — ammo boxes (`ammo_touch` has no hint call) and H15/H25.
The `"You get "` backpack opener is deliberately *not* decoded into a
typed event: its ammo breakdown arrives as separate per-piece prints
that would need stateful reassembly, and no consumer uses it.
`PrintEvent.TargetPlayerNum` carries the `dem_single` slot the server
addressed. **Caveat:** mvdsv's
`SV_ClientPrintf` (`mvdsv/src/sv_send.c:225`) drops prints where
`level < cl->messagelevel` before recording, so players with `msg 1`
or higher contribute *no* pickup prints to the MVD. Competitive
demos where everyone sets `msg 2` will have zero print-based pickup
events; always inspect the Level=0 count on a given demo before
leaning on this signal.

## Writing a new Source

To add a new input format (QTV live, a JSON event replay, something else),
implement `events.Source`:

```go
type Source interface {
    Next() (Event, error)
    Close() error
}
```

Emit the concrete event types from `mvd-reader/events`. The same analytics
pipeline that runs over an MVD file will now run over your new source with
no changes.

See `source/mvd/source.go` for a worked example: it registers a handler on
the parser that appends events to an internal queue, then `Next()` drains
the queue and pumps `parser.ParseOne()` when the queue runs dry.

**End-of-stream contract.** `Next()` returns `io.EOF` at a *clean* end of
stream. For an MVD that means either the byte stream simply runs out or the
server's standard termination — `svc_disconnect "EndOfDemo"` — is reached;
both map to `io.EOF`. Any other error means the stream was truncated or
corrupt, and it is surfaced only *after* every event the final failing
`ParseOne` had already queued has been drained, so a consumer still sees the
tail of a broken demo before the error. A well-behaved consumer therefore
treats `io.EOF` as success and any other error as a partial/failed parse
(the analytics registry records the latter into `result.errors`). A
`svc_disconnect` carrying any text other than `"EndOfDemo"` is treated as a
non-standard / inter-map disconnect and parsing continues past it.

## Pure parser access (no Source wrapper)

For tools that need to drive the parser directly — the diagnostic harness
flips it into warning-collection mode — `mvd-reader/parser` exposes `Parser`,
`NewParser(decoder)`, `OnEvent(handler)`, `Parse()`, `ParseOne()`, and
`SetDiagnosticMode(true)`.

## Running tests

```bash
go test ./mvd-reader/...
```

## Module boundary

mvd-reader has no dependency on mvd-analytics or mvd-web. It depends only on the
Go standard library. This is intentional: the event schema has to stay
stable across consumer changes, and independent test/release cadence is
the forcing function that keeps that invariant true.
