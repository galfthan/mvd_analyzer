# mvd-mcp — MCP shim for QuakeWorld demo analytics

`mvd-mcp` is a small (~5 MB) MCP server that forwards every tool call as
an HTTP request to a running [`mvd-api`](../mvd-api/README.md). It
carries no analytics code of its own — the binary is a wire-protocol
shim, and the response shapes are owned by `mvd-api`.

It has two transports:

- **stdio** (default) — one process per client, launched by the client
  (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code). This is the local mode.
- **streamable HTTP** (`-http ADDR`) — a long-lived server for hosted
  use. MCP itself is unauthenticated; the shim authenticates to mvd-api
  with its own service key. See [Hosted / HTTP mode](#hosted--http-mode)
  below.

Why split it from `mvd-api`?

- **Distribution.** End-users (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code)
  install one tiny binary; the heavy parser + cache lives on the
  server. The bundled-binary version was ~15 MB; this one is ~5 MB.
- **Stability.** `mvd-mcp` only depends on the REST wire contract.
  Analytics-side refactors don't force a shim release.
- **Future-extractable.** No `mvd-analytics` import — this module
  can be moved to its own repo when there's demand.

## Usage

```
mvd-mcp -api URL [-label TAG] [-timeout SECONDS]       # stdio (default)
mvd-mcp -http ADDR -api URL [-timeout SECONDS]         # streamable HTTP
mvd-mcp version
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-api`      | (required) | Base URL of a running `mvd-api` (e.g. `https://mvd-api.example.com` or `http://localhost:8080`) |
| `-http`     | `""`        | Serve MCP over streamable HTTP on `ADDR` (e.g. `:8081`) instead of stdio. See [Hosted / HTTP mode](#hosted--http-mode). Mutually exclusive with stdio. |
| `-label`    | `""`        | **stdio only.** Non-secret request-source tag forwarded as `Authorization: Bearer <label>`. Used for access-log analytics on the API side. Ignored in `-http` mode, and superseded by `MVD_API_KEY` when that is set. |
| `-timeout`  | `60`        | Per-request HTTP timeout in seconds |

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `MVD_API_KEY` | API key forwarded as `Authorization: Bearer` on every proxied `mvd-api` call. Required (as an operator-issued **service** key) when the target `mvd-api` runs with `-auth-dir`; unnecessary against a local no-auth `mvd-api`. An env var, not a flag, so the secret never shows in `ps`. This is the shim's **only** configuration secret — it needs no hub credentials, since `searchGames` proxies to `mvd-api` too. |

## Tool surface

Twenty-three tools. Inputs are typed Go structs with JSON-Schema inference
(this file); outputs are passed through as opaque JSON — see
[`../mvd-api/README.md`](../mvd-api/README.md) for the response shape
of each per-demo endpoint, and
[`../mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md`](../mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md)
for the view types (`BucketsView`, `EventsView`, etc.), the field-code
vocabulary, and the reducer registry.

| Tool | Backing |
|---|---|
| `searchGames` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/games/search` |
| `loadDemo` | `mvd-api` `POST /v1/demos/{id}` |
| `getOverview` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/overview` |
| `getDemoInfo` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/demoinfo` |
| `getPlayerStats` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/player-stats` |
| `getMetadata` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/metadata` |
| `getFrags` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/frags` |
| `getDamage` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/damage` |
| `getAim` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/aim` |
| `getLocGraph` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/loc-graph` |
| `getChat` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/chat` |
| `getBackpacks` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/backpacks` |
| `getItems` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/items` |
| `getMapEntitiesByMap` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/maps/{map}/entities` |
| `getWeaponPickups` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/weapon-pickups` |
| `getBuckets` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/buckets` |
| `getEvents` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/events` |
| `getStreamSlice` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/stream-slice` |
| `getStateAt` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/state-at` |
| `getLocTrails` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/loc-trails` |
| `getLocTable` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/loc-table` |
| `getRegionControl` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/region-control` |
| `listArtifacts` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/artifacts` |
| `getArtifact` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/artifacts/{name}` |

`demoId` is the string returned by `loadDemo` (`sha:HEX`) or any
`gameId:NNNN` reference.

### Curated tools vs. the generic artifact pair

The first twenty-one tools are **curated**: each wraps one analytics
section with a hand-written description and (where useful)
`players`/`weapons`/window filters — that ergonomics is the product
surface, and it stays. The last two are the **generic** DAG accessor:
`listArtifacts` returns the fetchable-artifact catalog — servable
artifacts only, trimmed to `{name, resultKey, cost, lazy, description}`
at the MCP layer (the full DAG manifest with `requires`/`provides`
edges and internal nodes stays on REST `/v1/artifacts` + `/v1/graph`) —
and `getArtifact` fetches one servable artifact by name. Heed size
notes in descriptions: `timeline` is one of the largest sections;
prefer the windowed views (getEvents/getBuckets/getRegionControl). This is how the automatic API
surface (plan §7) is realized here: a **new** analytics artifact becomes
reachable through `getArtifact` with **zero** new hand-written tools,
while the common sections keep their rich curated tools. Prefer the
curated tool when one exists (it filters and documents); reach for
`getArtifact` for artifacts that have no dedicated tool. `getArtifact`
takes no filters — parameterised reads are the curated view tools.

Tool errors come back as MCP `isError: true` results with the
upstream error message in `TextContent`. The model can read them and
recover (e.g. by calling `loadDemo` first).

### REST endpoints without an MCP tool

A few `mvd-api` REST endpoints have **no** curated MCP tool yet:
`/los`, `/shots`, `/streams/*`, and `/airgibs`. This asymmetry is
deliberate for now — those views are large or specialised, and adding
tools is deferred (they can still be fetched at the REST layer, and
`/los` is reachable generically via `getArtifact name=los`). See
[`../mvd-api/API.md`](../mvd-api/API.md) for the full endpoint list, or
the machine-readable OpenAPI spec the server itself serves at
`/openapi.yaml` (browsable at `/docs`).

## Hosted / HTTP mode

`mvd-mcp -http :8081 -api http://localhost:8080` serves MCP over
**streamable HTTP** instead of stdio, for hosting the service on the
public internet. This is the transport a remote client (Claude Code
`--transport http`, or any streamable-HTTP MCP client) connects to.

### Auth model

**MCP requests need no authentication.** Requiring a per-request bearer
key proved too cumbersome for the clients this transport exists for —
web AI chat connectors (claude.ai, ChatGPT, …) that can't easily attach
custom headers — and every tool is read-only over public demo data. API
keys remain the model for the REST API, which is aimed at services and
bulk integrations.

Upstream, the shim authenticates *itself*: the operator issues one
**service** key (`mvd-api keys issue -service -note mvd-mcp`) and hands
it to the shim via the `MVD_API_KEY` env var. Every proxied REST call
forwards it as `Authorization: Bearer`, so `mvd-api` keeps full key
auth, and its per-key rate limit on that one key acts as the global
throttle on anonymous MCP traffic.

Two escape hatches:

- A request that **does** carry `Authorization: Bearer qwmvd_…` has that
  key forwarded upstream instead of the service key — per-key
  attribution and rate limiting still work for keyed clients.
- A bearer that is *not* a `qwmvd_` key (e.g. an OAuth token a chat
  platform attaches on its own) is ignored rather than breaking the
  session.

The server also exposes a `GET /healthz` for liveness probes. The MCP
handler is mounted at `/mcp` (and `/mcp/`).

`-label` has no effect in HTTP mode; mvd-mcp logs a warning if it is set.

### Client config

Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http mvdanalyzer https://mvdanalyzer.com/mcp
```

JSON config form (e.g. `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mvdanalyzer": {
      "url": "https://mvdanalyzer.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Web chat connectors (claude.ai custom connectors and the like) just take
the URL `https://mvdanalyzer.com/mcp` — no headers or OAuth needed.

For the full deployment (Caddy TLS, systemd units, provisioning runbook)
see [`../deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md).

### stdio vs. HTTP

| | stdio (default) | HTTP (`-http`) |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | stdin/stdout | streamable HTTP |
| Lifecycle | one process per client | one long-lived server |
| MCP auth | none (local process) | none |
| Upstream auth | `MVD_API_KEY`, else `-label` (non-secret tag) | `MVD_API_KEY` service key; per-request `qwmvd_` bearer overrides |
| Use | local (Desktop/Cursor/Code) | hosted / remote |

### Input schemas

The Go types below are what `registerTools` declares; the MCP SDK
infers their JSON Schemas from struct tags and exposes them via
`tools/list`. Source of truth:
[`mcp_backend.go`](mcp_backend.go).

Every tool that maps to a demo endpoint (getOverview, getFrags,
getDamage, getAim, getChat, getBackpacks, getItems, getWeaponPickups,
getBuckets, getRegionControl, getEvents, getStreamSlice, getStateAt,
getLocTrails, getLocGraph) and carries match-position time echoes a
top-level constant `timeUnit` (`"ms"`) — every time value in the API is
int32 ms (pure-ms model). getLocGraph is on that list because
its node weights are int32-ms durations, and getArtifact responses carry
the echo for every time-bearing section too. The exceptions:
getDemoInfo is the KTX island (mixed KTX-native units), and
getMetadata, getLocTable and getMapEntities have no
match-position time to unit in the first place. There is no
unit-selection input. Field-name conventions follow the dense/sparse
rule: sparse event lists and singleton timestamps use `time`,
sample-rate-scaled dense arrays use `t` — both int32 ms — and descriptive
names (`startTime`, `endTime`, `nextDeathTime`, …) are int32 ms too, the
unit named by the constant `timeUnit` echo. See
[mvd-api/API.md §2.1](../mvd-api/API.md) for the per-endpoint values.

#### `searchGames(...)`

All fields optional; an empty filter returns the most recent matches.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `players`  | `string[]` | — | Player names; FTS on `players_fts`, AND'd across multiple |
| `teams`    | `string[]` | — | Team names; `contains` on `team_names` |
| `map`      | `string`   | — | Map name, exact match (e.g. `dm6`) |
| `mode`     | `string`   | — | Game mode, exact match (`1on1`, `2on2`, `4on4`, `FFA`) |
| `matchtag` | `string`   | — | Tournament/event tag, case-insensitive substring (e.g. `qwsl`) |
| `from`     | `string`   | — | ISO date lower bound, inclusive (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `to`       | `string`   | — | ISO date upper bound, inclusive (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `limit`    | `int`      | 20 | Max rows; capped at 100. Omit for the default; an explicit `0` is rejected `400 invalid_param` |
| `offset`   | `int`      | 0 | Pagination offset |
| `roster`   | `bool`     | `false` | `true` = verbatim hub rows with full roster detail (per-player `ping`, `color` arrays, `name_color`, `team_color`, `is_bot`). Default = compact rows: `players` projected to `{name, team, frags}`. |

Output: `{ limit, offset, count, total?, games: [row, ...] }`. `count`
is the rows in THIS page; `total` is all matching rows (from the
PostgREST `count=exact` preference — omitted if the hub doesn't report
it). Page with `limit`/`offset` until `offset+count >= total`. Row
fields: `id, timestamp, mode, matchtag, map, teams, players,
demo_sha256, demo_source_url` (`players` compacted unless
`roster: true`).

#### `loadDemo({gameId | sha256})`

Warms `mvd-api`'s cache for the demo and returns the canonical
`demoId` (`sha:HEX`). Idempotent — and **optional**: every analysis
tool accepts `gameId:N` directly and auto-loads on first use; loadDemo
just front-loads the parse cost.

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gameId` | `int`    | hub.quakeworld.nu game id |
| `sha256` | `string` | 64-char hex of a demo already in the local cache |

Exactly one of `gameId` / `sha256` must be set.

Output: `LoadDemoOutput` —
`{ demoId, sha256, fromCache, schemaVersion }`. The `demoId` is what
every subsequent per-demo tool expects.

#### `getOverview({demoId})`

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `demoId` | `string` (required) | `gameId:N` or `sha:HEX` |

Output: `Overview` —
see [`../mvd-api/README.md`](../mvd-api/README.md#rest-endpoints).

#### `getDemoInfo({demoId})`

KTX demoinfo blob pass-through — the authoritative scoreboard.

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `demoId` | `string` (required) | — |

Output: `result.DemoInfoResult`. Per-player `Weapons.<rl|lg|gl|ssg|ng>.acc`
(hit accuracy), `Weapons.<...>.kills`, `Items.<RA|YA|GA|MH|...>.count`,
`Dmg.taken/given`, `Spree.{quad,run,ring,pent}.{frags,duration}`,
RL/LG transfers, etc. Errors with `demoinfo_unavailable` (422) if the
demo has no KTX demoinfo block (rare; non-KTX or aborted matches).

#### `getPlayerStats({demoId, players?, teams?})`

The canonical per-player and per-team statistics — the one-call
scoreboard, available on **every** demo including old ones with no KTX
demoinfo block.

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `demoId` | `string` (required) | — |
| `players` | `string[]` | restrict to these players; also drops the team rows, which are whole-team sums |
| `teams` | `string[]` | restrict to these teams |

Output: `result.PlayerStatsResult` — per row `score` (corrected
frags/kills/deaths/suicides/teamKills + `efficiency`), `damage`,
`accuracy`, `pickups.byKind`, and `hold` (`weapons` / `armor` /
`powerups`), plus a `window` carrying the denominators
(`matchMs` / `presentMs` / `aliveMs` / `deadMs`).

Every family carries `src` (`"derived"` | `"ktx"`), with a `sources`
roll-up — `getDemoInfo` stays the verbatim KTX block to diff against.
The response keeps the same shape regardless of demo age: on a demo with
no KTX block, `accuracy` is reconstructed from the decoded fire stream
(trigger pulls, not KTX's pellets — check `src` before comparing across
demos), `damage.takenEnemy` / `takenToDie` come from the per-hit log, and
`login` from the `*auth` userinfo key. A value that cannot be measured
stays ABSENT rather than becoming a zero — notably
`accuracy.byWeapon[].hits` when the demo has no damage stream.
`efficiency`, `shareAlive` and `shareMatch` are RATIOS in [0,1], not
percentages.

**Possession time is unique to this tool.** KTX never writes weapon hold
time into the demoinfo block, and its armor hold time overcounts (the
clock keeps running after the armor is chewed to zero), so our armor
numbers read LOWER than a KTX end-of-match table by design.
`hold.armor.none` — time alive with no armor at all — has no KTX
equivalent.

Errors with `playerstats_unavailable` (422) only on a parse degraded to
no player streams; a missing KTX block is served normally.

#### `getMetadata({demoId})`

Server cvars + KTX match settings. Used to answer "what ruleset
was this played under".

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `demoId` | `string` (required) | — |

Output: `result.MetadataResult` — `serverInfo` (map of cvar →
value), `matchSettings` (mode, timelimit, fraglimit, antilag,
spawnmodel/spawnK, midair, instagib, overtime, powerups, vwep,
noweapon, matchtag, …), `countdownText` (raw KTX
countdown centerprint).

#### `getFrags({demoId, ...})`

Frag aggregates + the full kill log. Cheaper than aggregating
`getEvents(types:["frag"])` client-side.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`    | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `players`   | `string[]` | all | Restrict aggregates + log to entries involving these (killer OR victim) |
| `weapons`   | `string[]` | all | Restrict aggregates + log to these weapon codes (`rl`, `lg`, `gl`, `ssg`, `sng`, `ng`, `axe`, `sg`, …) |
| `startTime` | `integer` | match start | Window start, match-relative **milliseconds** (keep kills at `time ≥ startTime`) |
| `endTime`   | `integer` | match end | Window end, match-relative **milliseconds** (keep kills at `time ≤ endTime`) |
| `summary`   | `bool` | `false` | Return only aggregates, dropping the kill log. **Deliberately the opposite default from getDamage/getAim/getItems**: a kill log is one row per frag — small, and usually the point of the call. |

When any scoping filter (`players` / `weapons` / `startTime` / `endTime`) is
set, **every** aggregate is recomputed from the filtered kill log (consistent
with the entries shown); with none set the authoritative stored totals are
returned. Filtered aggregates are log-sourced and may differ slightly from the
unfiltered totals for reconnect / unresolved-name edge cases.

Output: `result.FragResult` —
`{ totalFrags, byPlayer: {name: {kills, deaths, byWeapon}}, byWeapon: {weapon: count}, frags: [{time, killer, victim, weapon, isSuicide, isTeamKill}, ...] }`.

#### `getDamage({demoId, ...})`

Per-hit damage aggregates + log, reconstructed from the KTX
`mvdhidden_dmgdone` stream. Cheaper than aggregating
`getEvents(types:["damage"])` client-side; use that for the raw
time-ordered per-hit log.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`    | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `players`   | `string[]` | all | Restrict aggregates + log to entries involving these (attacker OR victim) |
| `weapons`   | `string[]` | all | Restrict to these **attacker** weapon codes (`rl`, `lg`, `gl`, `ssg`, `sng`, `sg`, `tele`, …) |
| `startTime` | `integer` | match start | Window start, match-relative **milliseconds** (keep hits at `time ≥ startTime`) |
| `endTime`   | `integer` | match end | Window end, match-relative **milliseconds** (keep hits at `time ≤ endTime`) |
| `summary`   | `bool` | **`true`** (MCP-only default) | Aggregates only, the big per-hit damage log dropped. Pass `false` for the full log (REST `/damage` defaults to the full log; the defaulted MCP response carries a `hint` field saying how to opt out). |

The damage output — the aggregates AND the per-hit `events` log — is
**match-only**: out-of-match (warmup / post-match) hits are dropped at the
source and never appear (schema v50).

When any scoping filter (`players` / `weapons` / `startTime` / `endTime`) is
set, **every** aggregate (`totalDamage`, `byPlayer`, `byWeapon`, `matrix`) is
recomputed from the filtered per-hit log — this also populates `matrix` /
`events` on filtered responses (previously null). Because `events` is
match-gated at the source, an all-players recompute reproduces the stored
totals exactly. With none set the authoritative stored totals are returned.

Output: `result.DamageResult` — `{ totalDamage, byWeapon, byPlayer: {name:
{given, taken, givenTeam, givenSelf, takenEnv, byWeapon, byWeaponTeam,
byWeaponSelf, enemyVsSg,
enemyVsMid, enemyVsLg, enemyVsRl, enemyVsBoth, ewep}}, matrix: [{attacker,
victim, damage, byWeapon}], events: [{time, attacker, victim, weapon,
damage, victimWep, ...}], scoreboard }`. The three per-weapon maps split
`given` / `givenTeam` / `givenSelf` by the **attacker's** weapon on the
same keys (telefrags and stomps are excluded from all three; `matrix` and
the `enemyVs*` buckets stay enemy-only). `byWeaponTeam` / `byWeaponSelf`
are `omitempty` but **measured whenever the damage family is present** —
an absent key means "dealt none with that weapon", never "not measured". **EWep** (= `enemyVsLg +
enemyVsRl + enemyVsBoth`) is damage dealt to enemies *holding* RL/LG,
keyed on the **victim's** inventory. Amounts are **unbound** (include
overkill; a telefrag reports 9999), so totals run higher than the KTX
scoreboard — see `scoreboard` for the cross-check.

#### `getAim({demoId, players?, startTime?, endTime?, summary?})`

Per-player aim analysis. Start with `players[].weapons` (per-weapon
shots/hits, SG/SSG pellet stats + full/partial/miss fires, RL/GL
direct/splash/missed, the LG miss/blocked/out-of-range whiff split); the
columnar `crosshair` (per-hitscan-fire angular error, normalized so ±1 =
the hitbox edge, with hit + attributed target) and `lgRamp` (per-LG-cell
hit vs ms since the shaft opened) blocks are large — reach for them only
when per-shot detail is needed.

**`summary: true` is the MCP-layer default** — it returns just the compact
per-player `weapons` aggregates and drops the large per-fire `crosshair` +
`lgRamp` sample arrays, which otherwise dominate the payload and can overflow
context. Pass `summary: false` for the full arrays (REST `/aim` defaults to
the full shape; the defaulted MCP response carries a `hint` field saying how
to opt out).

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `demoId` | `string` (required) | — |
| `players` | `string[]` | scope to these shooters. With no time window, selects their **match-wide** aim; with a window, restricts the recompute. |
| `startTime` | `integer` | window start, match-relative **milliseconds**. Setting a window **recomputes** aim over the shots in it, so every figure (weapons, crosshair, lgRamp) scopes to the window. |
| `endTime` | `integer` | window end, match-relative milliseconds. |
| `summary` | `bool` | **default `true` (MCP-only)**: only the `weapons` aggregates, the per-fire `crosshair`/`lgRamp` arrays dropped. Pass `false` for the full arrays. |

With no time window the **stored** match-wide aim is served (no recompute);
`players`/`summary` still apply. The `shots`/`damage` inputs aim derives from
are already match-only, so aim never includes warmup / post-match fires.

Output: `result.AimResult` — see
[RESULT_SCHEMA.md §AimResult](../mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md#aimresult-aim).
`mode` flags attribution quality per player: `duel` (exact, one enemy) or
`team` (nearest-crosshair-enemy heuristic). The first call on a demo may be
slow — the API builds the projectile/beam streams on first request.

#### `getLocGraph({demoId})`

Per-map adjacency graph of named locations.

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `demoId` | `string` (required) | — |

Output: `result.LocGraphResult` —
`{ locs: [{ name, x, y, z, ... }, ...], edges: [{ from, to, weight, ... }, ...] }`.
Useful for movement-pattern reasoning ("what's adjacent to RA?",
"which paths connect quad to RL?").

#### `getChat({demoId, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`    | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `startTime` | `integer` | match start | Window start, match-relative milliseconds |
| `endTime`   | `integer` | match end | Window end, match-relative milliseconds |
| `players`   | `string[]` | all | Restrict to these speakers |
| `types`     | `string[]` | `["chat","teamsay"]` | Narrow to one of the two |

Output: `{ messages: []result.MatchEvent }` — each entry has `time`,
`type` (`chat` or `teamsay`), `player`, `team`, `message` (raw with
ezQuake markup), `messageClean` (markup stripped). Cleaner shape than
`getEvents(types:["chat"])` when you only want chat. (mvd-api returns a
`{timeUnit, messages}` envelope; the MCP tool passes it through.)

#### `getBackpacks({demoId, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`  | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `players` | `string[]` | all | Restrict to drops by these dropper names |
| `weapons` | `string[]` | both | Dropped-weapon codes (`rl`, `lg`); forwarded as a CSV set, matching REST `/backpacks` |
| `startTime`/`endTime` | `integer` | full match | Match-relative **milliseconds**; windows the drop time |

Output: `{ backpacks: []result.BackpackDrop }` — each entry has `time`,
`player` (dropper), `team`, `weapon` (`rl`/`lg`), `origin` (XYZ), `loc`
(resolved name), `entNum` (server edict — joins to
`weapon-pickups[].backpackEnt`). (REST returns a `{timeUnit, backpacks}`
envelope; the MCP tool passes it through.)

#### `getItems({demoId, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`  | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `items`   | `string[]` | all | Item name or kind token, case-insensitive. A kind matches every instance of a type (`YA` → `ya_1`, `ya_2`; `RA`; `MH`; `Quad`; `Pent`; `Ring`; `RL`; `LG`; `GL`; `SSG`; `SNG`; `NG`); a suffixed name matches one instance (`ya_1`). |
| `players` | `string[]` | all | Restrict phases to those taken by these names; phases with no `takenBy` survive |
| `kinds`   | `string[]` | all | Category, case-insensitive: `armor`, `mega`, `health`, `powerup`, `weapon`, `ammo`. A raw kind token (`ra`, `quad`, …) also matches. |
| `startTime`/`endTime` | `integer` | full match | Match-relative **milliseconds**. Timeline mode keeps phases **overlapping** the window; summary mode counts takes **inside** it. `endTime: 60000` = the opening minute. |
| `summary` | `bool` | **`true`** (MCP-only default) | Per-item take aggregates `{takenCount, byPlayer, firstTake}` instead of the full phase timeline. Pass `false` for every phase (REST `/items` defaults to the timeline; the defaulted MCP response carries a `hint` field saying how to opt out). |

Summary output: `{ items: [{ name, kind, entNum, loc?, takenCount,
byPlayer?: {name: n}, firstTake?: { time, takenBy?, team? } }] }` — `time`
in match-relative milliseconds. The one-call shape for "who took which YA, and
who got there first".

Timeline output (`summary: false`): `result.ItemsResult` —
`{ items: [{ name, kind, entNum, x, y, z, loc, phases: [...] }, ...] }`.
`name` is unique per item (suffixed when a map has several of a kind:
`ya_1`, `ya_2`, `mh_1`); `kind` is the raw token (`ra`/`ya`/`mh`/`quad`/
`rl`/…). Each phase: `availableFrom`, `takenAt`, `takenBy`, `team`,
`respawnAt`.

#### `getWeaponPickups({demoId, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`  | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `players` | `string[]` | all | Restrict to picks by these names |
| `weapons` | `string[]` | all | `rl`, `lg`, `gl`, `ssg`, `sng`, `ng` |
| `source`  | `string`   | both | `world` (spawner) or `backpack` (RL/LG drop) |
| `startTime`/`endTime` | `integer` | full match | Match-relative **milliseconds**; windows the pickup time |

Output: `{ pickups: []result.WeaponPickup }` — each entry has `time`,
`player`, `team`, `weapon`, `source`, `hadBefore`, `kills` (before
picker's next death), `nextDeathTime`, plus for backpack pickups
`backpackEnt`, `dropper`, `dropperTeam`, `dropTime`. Joins to
`getBackpacks` via `backpackEnt` == `backpacks[].entNum`. (REST returns a
`{timeUnit, pickups}` envelope; the MCP tool passes it through.)

#### `getBuckets({demoId, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`      | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `windowMs`    | `int`     | **5000** (MCP default) | Bucket size in ms. The REST API itself defaults to 50 — the MCP proxy injects 5000 when the caller omits it: 50 ms emits ~24K buckets per match and even 1 s is ~1200 per field per player, while 5 s resolves the trend/control questions a bucketed timeline answers (a quad run is 30 s). Pass an explicit value (1000, 50, …) to override either way; for instants use getStateAt, for exact events getEvents. |
| `startTime`   | `integer` | match start | Window start, match-relative milliseconds |
| `endTime`     | `integer` | match end | Window end, match-relative milliseconds |
| `players`     | `string[]` | all | Restrict to these player names |
| `fields`      | `string[]` | all standard | Field codes — see RESULT_SCHEMA.md |
| `reducers`    | `{[code]: name}` | per-field defaults | Reducer-name override per field |
| `includeTeam` | `bool`    | `false` | Also emit per-team aggregates per bucket |
| `loc`         | `string`  | `name` | Ignored for `layout=column` (always the raw `li` index + a `locTable` legend in the envelope to decode it — no `getLocTable` call needed) |
| `layout`      | `string`  | **`column`** | `column` = compact column-major `ColumnarBuckets` (one array per `(player,field)`, `time(i)=start+i*windowMs`, booleans 0/1); `row` = one self-describing object per bucket. Prefer column for series/trend reads; use `getStateAt` for snapshots. |

Output: `view.ColumnarBuckets` (default) or `view.BucketsView` (`layout=row`)
— see [RESULT_SCHEMA.md → Buckets](../mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md#buckets).

#### `getEvents({demoId, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`    | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `startTime` | `integer` | match start | Match-relative milliseconds |
| `endTime`   | `integer` | match end | Match-relative milliseconds |
| `players`   | `string[]` | all | — |
| `types`     | `string[]` | discrete-event default set | `frag, powerup, streak, spawn, death, weapon, item, chat, pickup, demomark, airgib, pause` (default), opt-in: `loc, health, armor, damage, telefrag, stomp` |

Output: `view.EventsView` —
`{ events: [{ time, type, player, detail }, …] }`. Per-type `detail`
keys are in RESULT_SCHEMA.md.

#### `getStreamSlice({demoId, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`    | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `startTime` | `integer` | — | **At least one of startTime/endTime is required at the MCP layer** — an unwindowed slice is native-rate entries for the whole match, the biggest payload this service can emit. Keep windows tens of thousands of ms (tens of seconds). Match-relative milliseconds. (REST `/stream-slice` stays unwindowed.) |
| `endTime`   | `integer` | — | See `startTime`. Match-relative milliseconds. |
| `players`   | `string[]` | all | — |
| `fields`    | `string[]` | all standard | — |

Output: `view.StreamSliceView`. Per-player change-stream entries
inside the window (carry-forward entry prepended at `startTime`;
intervals clamped to the window).

#### `getStateAt({demoId, time, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`  | `string`  (required) | — | — |
| `time`    | `integer` (required) | — | Match-relative milliseconds |
| `players` | `string[]` | all | — |
| `fields`  | `string[]` | all standard minus `sp`/`d` | Spawn/death timestamps are rejected — they're events, not state |

Output: `view.StateAtView` — `{ time, players: { name: {...fields} } }`.
Change streams resolve to "latest entry ≤ time" (carry-forward);
intervals to membership; position to nearest sample.

#### `getLocTrails({demoId, ...})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`     | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `players`    | `string[]` | all | — |
| `minDwellMs` | `int`     | **250** (MCP default; REST 0) | Drop residences shorter than this (nearest-loc flicker), folded into neighbour. Pass `0` explicitly for the raw stream. |
| `startTime`  | `integer` | match start | Match-relative milliseconds |
| `endTime`    | `integer` | match end | Match-relative milliseconds |

Output: `view.LocTrailsView` —
`{ players: [{ name, sequence: [{ start, end, loc }, …] }, …] }`.

#### `getRegionControl({demoId, windowMs?, startTime?, endTime?, regions?})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId`   | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `windowMs` | `int` | **5000** (MCP default) | Bucket size for the per-region state strings. Same MCP-vs-REST split as `getBuckets`: REST default is 50, MCP proxy injects 5000 to keep `bucketStates` lengths manageable (a 20-min match: 240 chars per region instead of 24K). |
| `startTime`/`endTime` | `integer` | full match | Match-relative **milliseconds**; windows the bucket range |
| `regions` | `string` | **`summary`** (MCP default) | Polygon detail: `full` (each region's ~6 KB `points` polygon included — needed only to draw the map overlay), `summary` (points stripped; `name`/`locs`/`centroidX`/`centroidY` kept), `none` (regions list omitted). Same MCP-vs-REST divergent default as `getItems` `summary`: REST defaults to `full`, the MCP proxy injects `summary` and a defaulted response carries a `hint`. Pass `regions:'full'` for the points. |

Output: `result.RegionControlResult`. Errors with
`region_control_unavailable` (HTTP 422) if the demo's map has no
region layout. See RESULT_SCHEMA.md for the encoding of
`bucketStates` (per-region one-char-per-bucket string) and `stats`
(match-aggregate percentages).

#### `listArtifacts({})`

No parameters. Output: the fetchable-artifact catalog
`{ schemaVersion, artifacts: [{ name, resultKey, cost, lazy,
description }, …] }` — trimmed at the MCP layer to servable artifacts
and routing-relevant fields (the full DAG manifest with
`requires`/`provides`/`mutates` edges and internal nodes lives on REST
`/v1/artifacts` + `/v1/graph`). Static per schema version. The
authoritative catalog is the generated
[`../mvd-analytics/ARTIFACTS.md`](../mvd-analytics/ARTIFACTS.md). Call
this to discover artifacts beyond the curated tools.

#### `getArtifact({demoId, name})`

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demoId` | `string` (required) | — | — |
| `name`   | `string` (required) | — | Artifact name from `listArtifacts` (e.g. `frag`, `damage`, `loc-graph`, `los`). Must be `servable`. |

Output: the artifact's Result section under its `resultKey` (e.g.
`name: "frag"` → `{ "frags": … }`). `los` is
materialised on demand (first call may be slow). No filters — for
filtered reads use the curated tools. Errors with `artifact_unknown`
(HTTP 404) for an unknown or non-servable name.

### Search routes through mvd-api

Discovery (finding demos by player names, teams, map, etc.) is
hub.quakeworld.nu's data, but the shim does **not** talk to the hub
directly. `searchGames` proxies to `mvd-api`'s `GET /v1/games/search`
like every other tool, so `mvd-api` is the single egress point and the
only place the hub connection (URL + anon key) is configured. The shim
holds no hub secrets and needs no hub env vars.

This was once the one exception — the shim queried the hub's public
Supabase endpoint itself — but that split meant two code paths to the
hub and hub credentials in two places. Now that `mvd-api` owns the
search endpoint, the shim is a uniform proxy: one backend, one key.

## Local MCP

The shim has no local-cache mode. For local MCP, run `mvd-api` on
`localhost` and point the shim at it:

```bash
mvd-api -addr :8080 -cache-dir ~/.cache/mvd-api &
mvd-mcp -api http://localhost:8080 -label local-mcp
```

Two binaries, ~zero startup cost. The deliberate trade-off vs. a
bundled binary is that the shim stays tiny and the wire contract
stays clean.

## Client integration

See [`CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md`](CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md) for copy-paste config
snippets for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor, on Windows /
macOS / Linux.

## Build

```bash
make build-mcp                              # host platform
make build-mcp-windows                      # dist/mvd-mcp-windows-amd64.exe
make build-mcp-darwin                       # dist/mvd-mcp-darwin-{amd64,arm64}
make build-mcp-linux                        # dist/mvd-mcp-linux-amd64
make build-all-platforms                    # everything above + mvd-api targets
```

## Typical session shape

1. `searchGames({player: "bps", map: "dm6"})` → list of recent
   matches with rosters, scores, dates from the hub catalog (via
   `mvd-api`'s `GET /v1/games/search`). Cheap — no demo parse; the
   agent can filter / rank from the rows.
2. `loadDemo({gameId: 12345})` → tells `mvd-api` to fetch + parse +
   cache. Slow only on cold demos.
3. `getOverview` / `getBuckets` / `getStateAt` / ... → analytics for
   the chosen demo. Fast on warm cache.

If the answer is in the search-result rows alone (e.g. "what was
the score?"), the agent should stop there — no need to parse.

## Module dependencies

```
github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk v1.6.0
```

That's it. No `mvd-analytics`, no `mvd-api`, no parser. Just the MCP
SDK and stdlib (`net/http`, `encoding/json`, `log/slog`, etc.).
