// through `sr`, which proxies to mvd-api's GET /v1/games/search — normally
// the same *proxyBackend as `b`. mvd-api owns the hub connection, so the
// shim needs no hub configuration and has a single egress point. The seam
// stays a distinct interface only so tool tests can inject a fake searcher.

Pick a family with dmg=raw|bounded|both. Default: an unset dmg resolves to BOUNDED for BOTH the summary (this layer's default) and the full log — the KTX-scoreboard number a reader usually wants. raw (the lean unbound v53 shape) and both (raw fields PLUS a per-player `bounded` nest and a per-event `bounded`) stay explicit opt-ins; a defaulted summary response carries a hint — pass summary:false for the per-hit events log (same bounded family). On a bounded/both SUMMARY the per-player bounded figures are sourced from the EXACT KTX end-of-match scoreboard when the demo carries demoInfo (boundedSource echoes 'ktx' vs 'reconstructed'); `taken` and the enemyVs* buckets stay reconstructed (KTX has no matching split), so on a KTX-sourced summary they may not sum exactly to given. An EXPLICIT dmg=bounded errors (bounded_unavailable) on midair / instagib / dmgfrags demos, whose server mode rewrites the take in ways the wire doesn't expose; a DEFAULTED bounded there falls back to raw instead. boundedMode echoes 'standard' or 'skipped:midair|instagib|dmgfrags', and every bounded field is absent when skipped. The per-event `bounded` is OMITTED when it equals the raw damage (the common no-overkill case; note 0 is a real value — a fully-nullified pent/teamplay hit). Optional players= / weapons= / startTime/endTime filters; any filter recomputes every aggregate from the filtered log. Positional instant kills — telefrags (the 9999 instakill sentinel) and stomps (head-stomps) — are EXCLUDED from byWeapon/matrix/totalDamage and listed separately (telefrags/stomps lists + per-player counts), BUT their damage DOES fold into given/givenTeam/taken — and, for enemy kills, the EWep victim-weapon buckets — in both families, matching KTX; each telefrags[]/stomps[] entry carries that folded value as `bounded` (and `damage` when the raw fold differs). On skipped:* demos NO fold happens at all — the raw family reverts to pure exclusion. Shape vocabulary: totalDamage + byWeapon (enemy damage per attacker weapon) + byPlayer (given (to enemies), taken (all sources), givenTeam, givenSelf, takenEnv, byWeapon, and the EWep victim-weapon buckets enemyVsSg/enemyVsMid/enemyVsLg/enemyVsRl/enemyVsBoth where ewep=lg+rl+both = damage to enemies holding RL/LG) + matrix (attacker->victim totals) + scoreboard (stream-vs-KTX cross-check; carries a bounded side for the like-for-like compare). Empty-log convention: events is null when dropped by summary, [] when included but the filter matched nothing.
