# Release notes

Feature-level changes as they land on `main`, newest first. Dates are
the merge dates on `main`; schema bumps reference
[RESULT_SCHEMA.md](mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md) for field-level
detail.

## 2026-07-23 (add-airgib-pause-events) — view-layer change, no schema bump

Put **airgibs and pauses on the default event stream**. Both signals
already existed in the Result — airgibs in `timelineAnalysis.airgibs`
(plus the REST-only `/v1/demos/{id}/airgibs` endpoint) and pauses in
`streams.global.pauses` — but neither was reachable from the MCP
surface (only the curated tools proxy REST endpoints, and `getEvents`
didn't emit them). This wires both into `/v1/demos/{id}/events`, which
`getEvents` proxies, closing the MCP-discoverability gap.

- **`airgib` event** — a direct enemy rocket hit on an airborne victim
  (the Key Moments highlight). `player` is the attacker; `detail`
  carries `victim`, `height`, `damage`, and the optional `attackerTeam`
  / `victimTeam` / `heightAboveAttacker` / `loc` / `lethal`.
- **`pause` event** — a game-clock freeze segment. It has **no**
  `player` (so a `players=` filter excludes it) and carries
  `detail.durationMs`, the real wall-clock ms the pause consumed.
- Both join the `/events` **default** type set, so a caller that omits
  `types` begins seeing the new rows.
- **New drift test** (`mvd-api/mcp_reachability_test.go`): every
  demo-scoped REST GET view endpoint must be reachable from the MCP
  surface — via a curated tool, an event type, or a servable artifact —
  so a future endpoint can't ship MCP-invisible the way `/airgibs` did.
- View-layer only: no stored struct or schema version changed. Clients
  on `/v1` that ignore unknown enum values are unaffected.

## 2026-07-23 (demo-marker) — schema v58, additive

Surface **demo markers** — the bookmarks players insert during a game
with KTX's `/demomark` command — through the whole pipeline.

- **Layer 1.** New `DemoMarkEvent` emitted from the `//demomark`
  stufftext alongside the generic `StuffTextEvent`. Attribution comes
  only from the demo block target (the marking player's slot), matching
  a token boundary so `//demomarkX` is not a marker; the optional
  argument tail (HoonyMode `//demomark 0 round-07`) is captured as a
  label. Un-gated — markers inserted out of match are surfaced too.
- **Layer 2.** New `timelineAnalysis.demoMarkers[]` (`[]DemoMarkerEvent`):
  match-relative `time` (negative for a warmup mark), the marking
  player's resolved `playerName`/`playerSlot`/`playerUserID`/`team`
  (empty with `playerSlot: -1` when the block was not slot-addressed),
  a `spectator` flag (KTX accepts `/demomark` from spectators too),
  and the optional `label`. Team labels flow through the born-correct
  duel rewrite like the sibling event lists.
- **API.** New `demomark` event type on `/v1/demos/{id}/events`, added to
  the **default** type set — a caller that omits `types` begins seeing
  the new rows. `info.version`/`schemaVersion` → 58.
- Additive: no existing field or behaviour changed. Clients on `/v1`
  that ignore unknown fields and enum values are unaffected. See
  [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md) v58 and the new
  API-versioning note in [mvd-api/API.md §2.7](mvd-api/API.md).

## 2026-07-22 (clean-out-seconds-from-pipeline) — internal refactor, no schema change

Integer-milliseconds end to end through mvd-reader → mvd-analytics.
**No schema bump, no API change, and the result JSON is byte-identical**
— the full golden corpus (4on4 / 2on2 / 1on1 + reconnect) passes
unchanged without `-update-golden`, which is the acceptance proof that
the change is lossless.

- **The events contract carries only `TimeMs int32`.** Phase 1 deleted
  the float-seconds `Time` field from every event struct; this change
  removes the last float-seconds *time* from the analyzers. Every event
  now also exposes `EventTimeMs() int32` on the `Event` interface
  (twin of the presentation-only `EventTime() float64`).
- **Analyzers consume integer ms natively.** Deleted the `analyzer.msTime`
  float→ms shim and all ~64 `events.Sec(e.TimeMs)` call sites; the
  death/spawn ledger, pause samples, `MatchTimingDetector` start/end,
  item respawn timers (`kindRespawnMs`), weapon-pickup windows, and the
  item-attribution correlation windows are all int32 ms. The match-end
  fallback is now computed once via `MatchTimingDetector.EffectiveEndMs`
  instead of duplicated float logic in the clock and the timeline.
- `events.Sec(ms)` survives as the sanctioned presentation-edge helper
  (currently uncalled — qw-analyze derives via `EventTime()`, and the
  parser diagnostic inlines the conversion to avoid an import cycle).
  The one wire-native float-seconds time, `ServerData.ServerTime`
  (id1 `svc_serverdata`), is unchanged.
- Two behavior notes, no Result impact: the `qw-analyze -format events`
  raw dump now serializes `TimeMs` where it used to show a float `Time`
  field (the structs changed; the dump mirrors them), and exact-boundary
  window comparisons (e.g. a hint exactly 250 ms before a state flip)
  are now deterministic where the old float math was rounding-dependent
  at the boundary — no corpus demo hits such a boundary, hence the
  byte-identical goldens.

## 2026-07-22 (api-cleanup-2) — schema v57 (in progress, unreleased)

The `api-cleanup-2` release addresses the v56 API-review findings in
phases; the schema bump 56→57 and the pure-ms time model land in a later
phase. Each phase appends its own subsection below.

### Phase 1: request validation (`unknown_param` + enum values)

No response-shape change — this phase only tightens which requests are
*rejected*.

- **Unknown query-parameter names now 400 with a new `unknown_param`
  code.** Previously an unrecognised query key (a typo, a stale param) was
  silently ignored, so a mistaken filter returned an unfiltered body. Every
  endpoint now rejects any query key it does not consume, naming the
  offending key and the endpoint's accepted keys in the message. Enforced
  by consumed-key tracking in the shared `qp` reader (each accessor records
  the keys it reads), so the accepted set can never drift from what the
  handler actually uses. Two-direction spec↔handler test sweep pins it.
- **The global `label` traffic-source tag is accepted on every endpoint**
  (it is read by request logging, not any handler), so tagging traffic with
  `?label=…` never 400s.
- **Legacy / accepted-and-ignored params stay accepted.** The retired
  `nails` opt-in on `/shots` and the deprecated `weapon` alias of `weapons`
  are whitelisted (documented `deprecated` in the spec) rather than rejected.
- **Unknown enum *values* now 400 `invalid_param` instead of matching
  nothing.** `/events?types=` is validated against the known event-type
  vocabulary (`view.KnownEventTypes`, drift-pinned to the spec enum) and
  `/chat?types=` against `{chat, teamsay}`. `weapons=` CSV values, `/items`
  tokens, and map-entity `types`/`kinds` stay open (data-derived
  vocabularies) — noted as out of scope.
- Check order per handler is `invalid_param` → `unknown_param` →
  `missing_param` / availability `422`; for `/los` the unknown-param check
  runs before the heavy raycast compute, and for `/region-control` /
  `/state-at` before the availability / missing-time checks.

### Phase 2: search fixes (dates, `server_hostname`, case docs)

Touches `GET /v1/games/search` (and its MCP `searchGames` proxy) only; no
schema bump.

- **Malformed search `from`/`to` now 400 `invalid_param` instead of 502.**
  The `from`/`to` calendar-date bounds are validated at the API boundary as
  strict `YYYY-MM-DD` (exactly 10 characters and a real date); a bad value
  fails fast with a client-side `400 invalid_param` rather than reaching the
  hub and surfacing as an opaque `502 hub_upstream`.
- **Search rows now include `server_hostname`** — the QuakeWorld server a
  game was played on (closes review finding 3). It is a snake_case hub
  passthrough (consistent with the `demo_sha256` island) and appears in both
  compact and `roster=true` rows. Added to the hubfetch select list and
  mirrored into the web app's direct-Supabase `SEARCH_SELECT`.
- **Doc fix: the search `players` filter is case-INsensitive** (finding 2).
  It is a PostgREST full-text search, which lowercases both query and
  indexed names (`to_tsvector`) — so `bps` and `BPS` match the same games.
  The spec/API.md/MCP text previously claimed it was case-sensitive; the
  claim is corrected and now contrasts it with the per-demo endpoints'
  exact, case-sensitive `players` filter. The search `from`/`to` (calendar
  dates) are likewise distinguished from the per-demo endpoints' `from`/`to`
  (match-relative times).

### Phase 3: `/los` no-BSP → 422 `los_unavailable`

Touches `GET /v1/demos/{id}/los` and `GET /v1/demos/{id}/artifacts/los`; no
schema bump. Closes review finding 6 and the v55 open cache-invalidation item.

- **The poisoned-cache failure class is eliminated at the root.** Previously
  `/los` on a map with no provisioned visibility BSP latched
  `Streams.LOSComputed` *before* the BSP check and returned `200` with empty
  intervals — an outcome that was then persisted to the tier-3 artifact cache
  and never retried, so provisioning the BSP afterwards did nothing until the
  cache was manually cleared. `analyzer.ComputeLOS` now returns a new
  `analyzer.ErrNoBSP` for the three no-usable-BSP causes (the demo carries no
  map name, no BSP is provisioned for the map, or a provisioned BSP fails to
  parse) and does **not** latch, persist, or cache anything. The latch is set
  only on a genuine compute or a legitimately empty `<2`-player demo (which
  stays cacheable). Retry is cheap — no empty gob is ever written.
- **`/los` now returns `422 los_unavailable`** for those cases, matching its
  `*_unavailable` siblings (`aim_unavailable`, `locgraph_unavailable`, …)
  instead of the misleading `200`-empty. Both the curated `/los` endpoint and
  the generic `/artifacts/los` route map `ErrNoBSP` to the same `422`.
- **Ops note: BSP provisioning heals on process restart.** `mapbsp` memoises
  its "not found" result per process, so once a BSP is shipped, restart the
  API (or wait for the memo to be dropped) and the next `/los` request computes
  and caches normally — no cache purge needed, because the no-BSP outcome was
  never cached in the first place. The corrupt-BSP branch keeps its own
  per-process negative memo so repeated requests don't re-parse the bad file.

### Phase 4: pure-ms time model + key renames (schema 56→57)

The breaking sweep. **Every time value in the API is now int32
milliseconds** — request params and response fields, REST and MCP alike.
This is the client-migration section: read the two tripwires first.

**⚠️ Tripwire 1 — the key moved, so the break is loud, not silent.**
The per-item time key follows a **dense/sparse rule**: event-scaled
sparse surfaces use the descriptive **`time`**, sample-rate-scaled dense
arrays use the terse **`t`** — both int32 ms. This is deliberately the
v55 spelling, which splits clients into two clean groups:

- **v55 `time`(ms) per-item keys and units are unchanged.** `/frags`,
  `/damage`, `/shots`, `/chat`, `/backpacks`, `/weapon-pickups` already
  carried their timestamp under `time` in int32 ms in v55; that key and
  unit are untouched in v57. **But four response *envelopes* moved**
  (v56, not v57): `/chat`, `/backpacks`, `/weapon-pickups`, and
  `/airgibs` changed from a bare top-level array to a `{timeUnit, <list>}`
  envelope, keyed `messages` / `backpacks` / `pickups` / `airgibs`
  respectively. That is a **loud break** — a v55 client iterating the
  response body directly now iterates an object and fails; reach through
  the named list key instead. The per-item keys and units inside are
  unchanged. `/frags`, `/damage`, `/shots` keep **truly-additive**
  envelopes (the `timeUnit` sibling was flattened onto the existing
  object), so old readers of those three are fine.
- **v55 `t`(seconds) readers on `/events`, `/buckets?layout=row`,
  `/state-at`, and `/items?summary` break loudly — by design.** Those
  surfaces carried `t` in float **seconds** in v55. In v57 the value is
  `time` in int32 **ms** — the `t` key is *gone*. A stale client reading
  `/events[].t` now gets `undefined` and fails fast instead of silently
  ingesting a 1000×-off number; re-read the field as `time` (already in
  ms). ⚠️ **A dual-key fallback does NOT protect you.** A v55-portable
  reader doing `ev.get("time", ev.get("t"))` (or `ev.t ?? ev.time`) is not
  caught by the loud break — the fallback now resolves to `time` and
  yields **ms where the code expected seconds**, a silent 1000× error.
  Drop the fallback and read `time` as ms.

The **same-key unit flips** left (value float seconds → int32 ms, key
kept — audit any code that read those as seconds):

- `/events` detail maps: `endTime` (powerup + streak details) and
  `duration` (streak detail). There is no `startTime` key.
- `/loc-graph` node time weights (`total`/`byPlayer`/`byTeam` plus the
  `armed`/`unarmed`/`quad`/`pent` breakdowns) — see [Post-review
  fixes](#post-review-fixes) below.

**⚠️ Tripwire 2 — `from`/`to`/`time` query params are now integer ms.**
On every demo endpoint these were float **seconds**; they are now
**integer milliseconds**. Old float-seconds values are rejected loudly:
`from=10.5` (or any non-integer) 400s `invalid_param` with an `(integer
milliseconds)` hint, rather than silently misfiltering, and a negative
value now 400s too (`must be >= 0`). Multiply your old seconds values by
1000. (Search `from`/`to` are unchanged — calendar dates `YYYY-MM-DD`.)
**But the tripwire only catches NON-INTEGER forms.** A whole-number value
that *was* meant as seconds — e.g. `from=60` (intending 60 s) — is a
perfectly valid integer ms and **cannot be detected**: it migrates
**silently** to a window 1000× too small (`from=60` now means 60 ms and
returns almost nothing instead of erroring). Audit every caller that
passed integer seconds and multiply by 1000.

**Unit flip — the seconds surfaces, now int32 ms (keys per the
dense/sparse rule):**

| Surface | v55 | v57 |
|---|---|---|
| `/events` rows | `t` float s | `time` int32 ms (`endTime`/`duration` in detail also ms) |
| `/buckets?layout=row` | per-bucket `t` float s | `time` int32 ms |
| `/state-at` | `t` float s (envelope) | `time` int32 ms |
| `/stream-slice` envelope | `startTime`/`endTime` float s | `start`/`end` int32 ms |
| `/loc-trails` | `s`/`e` float s | `start`/`end` int32 ms |
| `/items?summary=true` | `firstTake.t` float s | `firstTake.time` int32 ms |
| `/loc-graph` node weights | `total`/`byPlayer`/`byTeam` (+`armed`/`unarmed`/`quad`/`pent`) float s | same keys, int32 ms (see [Post-review fixes](#post-review-fixes)) |
| query params `from`/`to`/`time` | float s | integer ms |

**Key renames (JSON):**

| Old | New | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `o` / `iv` | `other` / `intervals` | `LosTrack` (`/los`, `/artifacts/los`, `pvs`) |
| `events` | `messages` | `MessagesResult` array — `/artifacts/messages` is now `{messages:{messages:[…]}}` |
| `startMs` | `start` | columnar `/buckets` axis (implicit `time(i)=start+i*windowMs`) |
| `t` | `time` | per-item time key on the flipped view surfaces: `/events`, `/buckets?layout=row`, `/state-at`, `/items` `firstTake` (the v55 `t`(seconds) → v57 `time`(ms); the stored sparse lists already spelled it `time`) |
| `startTime` / `endTime` | `start` / `end` | `/stream-slice` envelope |

**null → `[]`.** Governed top-level arrays that could serialize as `null`
now always serialize as `[]` when empty: `/events`, `/stream-slice`
`players`, `/loc-trails` `players`. Nested arrays deeper in a body may
still be `null`.

**`UnitSec` deletion + `timeUnit` constant.** `view.UnitSec` is deleted;
the view layer does no float time math. `timeUnit` is kept as a constant
`"ms"` self-description echo — now truthful on every governed response.

**Deliberate non-renames** (documented exceptions, unchanged in v57):
the dense/sparse time-key rule keeps the terse **`t`** on every
sample-rate-scaled array (stream tracks, aim samples, the columnar
`/buckets` grid, projectile/beam columns) and the descriptive **`time`**
on the sparse stored lists that already used it in v55 (frags, damage,
shots, chat, backpacks, weapon-pickups, opening takes, timeline events);
`result.Interval` keeps terse `s`/`e` (per-row keys in dense arrays stay
terse — the payload discipline is deliberate); projectile / beam `s*` /
`e*` column-family prefixes (`s`,`sx`… / `e`,`ez` — these *are* flight-time
bounds); `windowMs` / `partialLastMs` durations (already ms, names stay);
`/demoinfo` is the sole KTX-native seconds island.

`CurrentSchemaVersion` bumps 56→57; version-keyed ETags/cache paths
self-invalidate. MCP tool input schemas and descriptions move with REST.

### Phase 5: artifact timeUnit echo + spec completeness

Spec/doc pass on top of the v57 shapes; no further schema bump.

- **`/artifacts/{name}` now echoes `timeUnit:"ms"`.** The generic artifact
  envelope gains a top-level `"timeUnit":"ms"` **sibling** of the resultKey
  for every artifact whose stored section carries time —
  `frag`, `damage`, `shots`, `aim`, `opening`, `match`, `messages`,
  `timeline`, `items`, `backpacks`, `weapon-pickups`, `loc-graph` (audited
  per section against the backing `result.*` struct; `loc-graph` echoes
  because its node weights are int32-ms durations — see the post-review
  fix below). The no-time-field artifacts (`metadata`, `map-entities`) and
  the `/demoinfo` KTX-native
  island carry no echo; `/artifacts/los` keeps echoing via its `/los` body.
  The echo is now **required** in the spec on those artifact-envelope
  branches, so the self-description is guaranteed, not optional.
- **Per-track stream-slice column schemas.** The `/stream-slice` player
  tracks (`pos`/`view`/`hgt`/`lq`/`vel`) were one loose universal schema
  listing every column; they are now split into per-track schemas mirroring
  the slice projections (`pos` carries `li`, `view` carries `vp`/`vya`,
  `hgt` carries `h`, `lq` carries `lq`, `vel` carries `vx`/`vy`/`vz`; all
  share the `t`/`x`/`y`/`z` spine), so the spec can express which columns
  each track actually has.
- **Angle16 documented.** The `vp`/`vya` view angles (stream-slice `view`
  track and `/state-at`'s `view`) are raw angle16 wire shorts; their spec
  descriptions and API.md now carry the decode formula
  `deg = ((v mod 65536)+65536) mod 65536 × 360 / 65536` and contrast
  `/aim`'s `dyaw`/`dpitch`, which are float degrees.
- **Prose fixes.** ProjectileStreams/BeamStreams document the `s*`/`e*`
  spawn/end column-family prefix scheme (distinct from `result.Interval`'s
  terse per-row `s`/`e`); the messages schema notes the array includes
  `type:"frag"` lines, not just chat; `matchtag`'s lowercase-single-word
  casing is a documented exception.
- **100% OpenAPI description coverage.** Every property in
  `components.schemas` (recursively) and every `components.parameters` entry
  now carries a non-empty `description`, enforced by a new
  `TestOpenAPIDescriptionCoverage` walk (no allowlist; failures anchor the
  offending schema-path).

### Post-review fixes

Three follow-up fixes on top of the v57 shapes; no further schema bump.

- **`windowMs` overflow guard (400 instead of panic/garbage).** `windowMs`
  is cast to `int32` in the bucket-grid arithmetic; an unbounded value
  above `math.MaxInt32` (e.g. `?windowMs=4294967295`) wrapped negative,
  panicking the row layout (500) and serving a bogus negative `count` on
  the columnar layout (200). `view.resolveWindow` now rejects
  `windowMs > math.MaxInt32` (keeping the existing `< 0` reject) → **400
  `invalid_param`** on both `/buckets` layouts. The `bucketCount == 0` /
  `count == 0` grid guards are also hardened to `<= 0` defensively.
- **loc-graph node weights are now int32 ms (BREAKING for early-v57
  consumers).** `LocGraphResult` node time weights
  (`LocNode`/`LocWeights` `total`/`byPlayer`/`byTeam` and the
  `armed`/`unarmed`/`quad`/`pent` breakdowns) were still float64 **seconds**
  — the one surface the pure-ms flip missed. They are now **int32 ms**, so
  values are ×1000 and integer. Edge weights stay transition counts.
  `/loc-graph` and `/artifacts/loc-graph` now carry `timeUnit:"ms"`. Any
  consumer that read the early-v57 seconds values must divide by 1000 (or
  read them as ms).
- **Enum values are case-insensitive.** `/events` `types` and `/chat`
  `types` validated case-**sensitively** while every other token filter
  lowercases; `types=Frag` or `types=TEAMSAY` now validate and match
  (lowercased before validation and before use), matching the rest of the
  API.

### Post-release polish

Two doc/behaviour touch-ups on top of the v57 shapes; no further schema bump.

- **`label` is now documented per-endpoint in the OpenAPI spec (doc-only).**
  The non-secret `?label=` traffic-source tag (read by request logging,
  globally accepted on every request) was only described in the spec intro
  prose. It is now a reusable `Label` component parameter referenced by every
  operation's `parameters` list, so `/openapi.yaml` and `/docs` show it on
  each endpoint. No behaviour change — it was always accepted.
- **Search `limit > 100` / negatives now 400 instead of a silent clamp
  (behaviour tightening).** `GET /v1/games/search` previously clamped `limit`
  to the hub's 100-row page cap. In line with v57's reject-loudly posture it
  now returns **400 `invalid_param`** for a `limit` above 100 and for a
  negative `limit`/`offset`; `limit=0`/omitted still means the default 20.
  The MCP `searchGames` tool proxies this endpoint and inherits the 400.
  hubfetch keeps its clamp as a server-side belt for direct library callers.

## 2026-07-21 (tweak-api)

- **Review fixes — echo-rule completeness + hub read hardening (still
  schema v56, unreleased).**
  - `/los`, `/streams/projectiles`, `/streams/beams`, `/streams/nails` now
    carry the `"timeUnit": "ms"` echo (their columns are all int32 ms), so
    the documented "every time-carrying `/v1/demos/{id}/*` response echoes
    `timeUnit`" rule is true end to end. The rule's wording is corrected
    everywhere to its honest form: time-carrying responses echo, with
    `/demoinfo` and `/artifacts/{name}` exempt, and the three timeless
    responses (`/loc-table`, `/loc-graph`, `/metadata`) carry no echo.
    [v57 correction: `/loc-graph` node weights ARE time-valued — see v57
    Post-review fixes; they are int32 ms as of v57, so `/loc-graph` echoes
    `timeUnit:"ms"` and is no longer timeless.]
  - **Security.** `hubfetch` Search/Resolve now cap the upstream catalog
    read at 16 MiB (`maxCatalogBytes`) — previously an unbounded
    `io.ReadAll` let a compromised/buggy hub or a MITM of
    `HUB_SUPABASE_URL` OOM the API host. And `GET /v1/games/search` no
    longer echoes the raw upstream error (which can embed the hub URL +
    query) into its 502 body — it returns a generic message and logs the
    detail server-side.

- **Time-field polarity flip — `t` is ms, `time` is seconds (still schema
  v56, unreleased).** The time-field naming convention flips so it becomes
  exception-free:
  - **`t` = int32 milliseconds, ALWAYS** — sparse event lists and dense
    per-sample arrays alike. The dense stored arrays already used `t`-in-ms,
    so they conform without change — that is the point of this polarity, and
    the big sparse event lists (frags/damage/shots/chat/…) get the compact
    key for the compact type (a payload win).
  - **`time` = float64 seconds, ALWAYS.**
  - Descriptive names (`startTime`, `endTime`, `nextDeathTime`, `dropTime`,
    `duration`, `availableFrom`/`takenAt`/`respawnAt`, …) keep carrying the
    endpoint's native unit, declared by the `timeUnit` echo; `*Ms`-suffixed
    names (`startMs`, `windowMs`, `atMs`, `durationMs`) are unchanged;
    `/demoinfo` stays the KTX units island.
  - **JSON key renames.** Stored ms fields `json:"time"`→`json:"t"`
    (FragEntry, DamageEntry, PositionalKill, Shot, MatchEvent/chat,
    AirgibEvent, BackpackDrop, WeaponPickup, OpeningResult firstTakes,
    and the timeline frag/death/kill/powerup/streak events). Seconds view
    surfaces `json:"t"`→`json:"time"` (events `TaggedEvent`, buckets-row,
    state-at, items-summary `firstTake`). loc-trails residences rename
    `s`/`e`→`start`/`end`. Go field names are unchanged — only the JSON
    tags. The webapp reads, OpenAPI spec, MCP tool descriptions, and the
    committed golden corpus were updated in lock-step (golden diff audited
    as a pure key rename — no value changed). schemaVersion stays 56.

## 2026-07-15 (tweak-api)

- **`timeUnit` echo + codified time-unit naming convention (schema
  v56).** `timeUnit` is **the unit of every time value in a response**.
  **Every `/v1/demos/{id}/*` JSON response that carries match-position
  time values echoes a top-level `"timeUnit": "ms"|"s"`, except
  `/demoinfo` (mixed KTX-native units) and `/artifacts/{name}` (raw
  stored bytes). Responses with no match-position time — `/loc-table`,
  `/loc-graph`, `/metadata` — carry no echo.** There is **no unit
  selection** — an earlier `units=ms|s` conversion
  param was dropped as over-engineered (a parallel `any`-typed
  shadow-struct hierarchy with a field-drift hazard, for a divide-by-1000
  any client can do). The value is **fixed per endpoint**:
  - **Native ms**: `/frags`, `/damage`, `/shots`, `/chat`, `/airgibs`,
    `/backpacks`, `/weapon-pickups`, the `/items` full phase timeline,
    `/overview`, **`/aim`, `/buckets?layout=column`, `/region-control`**
    (new this pass — every value in each is ms, so the echo is a truthful
    `ms`; they used to carry none), and the dense columnar stream bodies
    **`/los`, `/streams/projectiles`, `/streams/beams`, `/streams/nails`**
    (int32-ms columns — added in the 2026-07-21 review pass so the echo
    rule is honest end to end). **Native seconds**:
    `/events`, `/state-at`, `/stream-slice` (envelope), `/loc-trails`,
    `/buckets?layout=row`, the `/items?summary=true` shape.
  - **Field-name conventions still hold.** The sparse match-position `t`
    (int32 ms) and `time` (float seconds) names are absolute on every
    endpoint (see the 2026-07-21 polarity-flip entry above), and dense
    per-sample arrays stay int32 ms under compact names — the
    `/stream-slice` embedded change/interval/position tracks (`t`/`s`/`e`
    are ms even though that envelope's `timeUnit` is `s`), the `/aim`
    crosshair `t` + `lgRamp` `since` samples, and the columnar `/buckets`
    axis `startMs` + `windowMs`. `/overview`'s `timing` block is a
    wall-clock island with explicit `*Ms` names.
  - **Shape change — bare arrays become objects.** To carry the
    `timeUnit` echo, the four endpoints that returned a top-level JSON
    array now return an envelope object: `/chat` →
    `{timeUnit, messages:[…]}`, `/airgibs` → `{timeUnit, airgibs:[…]}`,
    `/backpacks` → `{timeUnit, backpacks:[…]}`, `/weapon-pickups` →
    `{timeUnit, pickups:[…]}`. Consumers indexing the old top-level array
    must read the named field. This is the one non-additive change; every
    other endpoint just gains the additive `timeUnit` field.
  - **Escape hatch.** `GET /v1/demos/{id}/artifacts/{name}` serves the
    raw stored result sections in int32 ms as-is — no `timeUnit` — the
    way to always get the raw stored milliseconds.
  - Stored `result.*` structs stay int32 ms; the transport surface added
    only the `timeUnit` echo here (schemaVersion restamped to 56). The
    JSON *key* rename that finalized the polarity landed later in v56 —
    see the 2026-07-21 entry above. See
    [mvd-api/API.md §2.1](mvd-api/API.md) and
    [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md) §"Time units".

## 2026-07-14 (tweak-api)

- **MCP `searchGames` now routes through `mvd-api` (operator-facing, no
  schema bump).** The shim's one remaining direct-to-hub tool now proxies to
  `GET /v1/games/search` like every other tool, so `mvd-mcp` has a single
  egress point (`mvd-api`), holds no hub configuration or secrets, and no
  longer imports `hubfetch` (or any `mvd-analytics` code at all). **Deploy
  change:** drop `HUB_SUPABASE_URL` / `HUB_SUPABASE_KEY` from `mvd-mcp`'s
  `mcp.env` — its only secret is now `MVD_API_KEY`. The tool's request shape
  and `{limit, offset, count, total?, games}` response are unchanged; a hub
  failure surfaces as the API's `502 hub_upstream` message.

- **Hub URL / key / CDN moved out of the source into the environment
  (operator-facing, no schema bump).** `hubfetch` no longer compiles in the
  Supabase URL, anon key, and CDN base; `NewClient()` reads
  `HUB_SUPABASE_URL`, `HUB_SUPABASE_KEY`, and `HUB_CDN_URL` instead, so the
  key can rotate without a rebuild and never sits in the tree or the deploy
  examples. When unset the client returns a clear "hub not configured"
  error on use: `mvd-api` still starts and serves its local cache, but a
  cache miss and `GET /v1/games/search` return `502 hub_upstream`, and the
  MCP `searchGames` tool — which proxies to that endpoint — surfaces the
  same 502. **Deploy change:** add the three vars to `mvd-api`'s
  `secrets.env` only; `mvd-mcp` needs no hub vars (it routes search through
  the API) — see `deploy/README.md`. Golden-corpus tests are unaffected
  offline (they read the committed cache); only a cold cache needs the vars.

- **Game discovery over REST: `GET /v1/games/search` (no schema bump).**
  The hub.quakeworld.nu catalog search that used to live only in the MCP
  `searchGames` tool is now a first-class REST endpoint, so a plain HTTP
  client can find a `gameId` without the MCP shim. Query by `players`,
  `teams`, `map`, `mode`, `matchtag`, `from`/`to` (ISO dates), with
  `limit`/`offset` pagination and `roster` for verbatim rows; the response
  is the same `{limit, offset, count, total?, games}` the MCP tool returns
  (compact `{name, team, frags}` rosters by default). The query itself
  moved into the shared `hubfetch` package, so the REST endpoint and the
  MCP tool answer discovery identically. It proxies a live upstream, so it
  is uncached and maps hub failures to `502 hub_upstream`. No schema bump —
  the search response is not part of the demo `Result` (same as the upload
  endpoint before it).
- **BSP-derived features now work on demos with no KTX demoinfo block (no
  schema bump).** LOS/PVS, loc resolution, floor height (`pos.h`), liquid
  state (`pos.lq`), and region control were all gated on the KTX demoinfo
  hidden block (`res.DemoInfo.Map`). Older recorders — e.g. MVDSV 1.00 with
  KTX 1.43/1.44 (2024-era) — never emit that block: MVDSV writes it only when
  KTX issues `cmd demoinfo` (`mvdsv/src/sv_demo_misc.c:851`,
  `ktx/src/commands.c:7740`). Those demos got `DemoInfo == nil` and silently
  produced none of the above, even with positions recorded and the BSP
  provisioned. The map is now resolved through a single `EffectiveMap`
  accessor (`result.Result.EffectiveMap` post-hoc, `CoreOutputs.EffectiveMap`
  at pipeline time) that prefers the demoinfo map and falls back to the
  serverinfo `map` key — which every demo carries. No result **shape**
  changes; the affected fields simply populate where they were previously
  absent, so no `CurrentSchemaVersion` bump (consistent with prior
  "existing field now populates more often" changes). Requires the map's BSP
  to be provisioned, same as before.


## 2026-07-14 (deploy-upload-config)

- **Deployment: BSPs for LOS, explicit limits, memory ceiling (no schema
  bump).** Operator-facing only — no API behaviour changes.
  - **`/los` and `/airgibs` need map BSPs, and the unit now points at
    them** (`Environment=MVDA_BSP_DIR=/opt/mvd/bsps`). There is no
    `-bsp-dir` flag: `mapbsp` reads `$MVDA_BSP_DIR`, then a `bsps/` dir
    relative to the working directory. Provision the sha-pinned set with
    `scripts/fetch-bsps.sh`. **Gotcha now documented:** an absent BSP does
    not error — `BuildLOS` yields an *empty* LOS and `EnsureLOS` caches it
    to tier 3 like a real answer, so demos whose `/los` was served before
    the BSPs existed keep returning empty. Provisioning afterwards does
    not fix them; the lazy artifacts must be dropped
    (`rm -rf <cache-dir>/artifacts`). `cache prune` will not do it — it
    only sweeps stale-*version* gobs, and an empty-but-current LOS looks
    valid to it.
  - The upload and parse limits (`-max-upload-bytes`, `-upload-daily-*`,
    `-parse-timeout`) are now set explicitly in the shipped unit at their
    defaults, so the config states them rather than hiding them in the
    binary — notably that **uploads are on by default** and
    `-max-upload-bytes 0` is the kill switch.
  - `MemoryHigh`/`MemoryMax` added to the unit. Uploads let a stranger
    trigger a parse, and without a cgroup ceiling an overrun lets the
    kernel OOM-killer pick a victim across the whole box. **Tune to your
    box** — the shipped values assume ≥4 GiB of RAM.
- **Two security margins closed.** `loc.NormalizeMapName`'s
  `filepath.Base` is documented as a security boundary, not a
  convenience: the map name comes from the demo's `svc_serverdata` and
  feeds a filesystem path in the mapents/mapbsp/locvis loaders, so
  stripping directory components is what stops an uploaded demo declaring
  its map as `../../../../etc/passwd`. And `buildAimHist` now escapes its
  title — not a live XSS (both callers pass literals), but it interpolates
  into `innerHTML` and player names are attacker-controlled via any
  uploaded demo.

## 2026-07-13 (log-identity-fields)

- **Access log: `discord` + `key` identity fields (no schema bump).** The
  request line's `label` is the key's *note* when one is set, and the
  Discord portal stamps `note="portal"` on **every** key it issues — so
  all portal users pooled under a single `label=portal`, and their Discord
  name never reached the log. Attribution was effectively impossible.
  The request line now also carries `discord` (the Discord display name)
  and `key` (the 8-char hash prefix, the same one `keys list` prints, so
  it joins the log to the key store). Neither can be masked by a note.
  `label` is unchanged, so existing queries keep working; both new fields
  are empty on auth-exempt paths and 401s, where no key is resolved. The
  Bearer value and the full hash are still never logged.

## 2026-07-13 (add-upload)

- **Demo upload endpoint (`POST /v1/demos`, no schema bump).** Apps can
  now analyze a demo the user holds locally — the API counterpart of
  the web app's local-file flow. The raw request body (a `.mvd` or
  `.mvd.gz`, sniffed by gzip magic) is stored under the SHA-256 of its
  uncompressed content and parsed synchronously; the response is the
  same `{demoId, sha256, fromCache, schemaVersion}` shape as `loadDemo`,
  and every existing `GET /v1/demos/sha:…/*` endpoint works on it
  unchanged. Re-uploads are idempotent cache hits. **REST-only by
  design**: the tool is deliberately absent from `mvd-mcp`.
  - **Safeguards.** On-wire body cap (`-max-upload-bytes`, 64 MiB
    default, `0` disables the endpoint), 512 MiB decompressed cap, and
    in auth mode a per-key daily quota (`-upload-daily-bytes` /
    `-upload-daily-count`, 429 with `Retry-After`). A body that fails to
    parse — or parses to no actual game — is rejected 422 and its bytes
    removed, so the cache cannot be used as content-addressed storage
    for arbitrary data. Uploaded demos have no owner (readable by any
    key holder that knows the sha) and share the normal GC pool
    (evicted → re-upload); both documented in `API.md` and the OpenAPI
    description.
  - **Parser hardening (Layer 1).** Reachable-from-upload input bounds,
    protecting all callers: the MVD decoder now rejects wire block sizes
    over 8 MiB instead of allocating up to ~4 GiB from a crafted 4-byte
    header (mvdsv writes blocks from an 8 KiB buffer, `MAX_MVD_SIZE`),
    and `mvdfile` caps gzip decompression at 512 MiB with a distinct
    `ErrDecompressedTooLarge` sentinel. A new `-parse-timeout` (120s
    default) bounds how long any single cold parse can hold a parse
    slot.

## 2026-07-12 (phase-16.3)

- **The bounded damage family (schema v55).** Damage now ships in **two
  families**. The **raw** family is the v53 shape — the full hit
  including overkill, capped only at 9999, exactly the wire value
  (`unbound_dmg_dealt`, written mid-frame in `T_Damage`,
  `combat.c:795`). The new **bounded** family reconstructs KTX's own
  scoreboard `dmg_dealt` (`combat.c:783`) per hit — armor absorbed plus
  the health portion capped at the victim's remaining health — which
  until now existed only as `demoInfo`'s end-of-match totals. The
  additions are purely additive; every raw field is byte-stable except
  the tele/stomp fold-in below.
  - **Death-value reconstruction.** The wire hides the bounded value but
    reveals it almost exactly. A hit the victim **survives** has no
    overkill, so `bounded == raw` identically — no health knowledge
    needed, only that no death happened this frame. A **killing** hit's
    overkill is the end-of-frame death broadcast KTX writes (`health -=
    take`, then the negative leftover or `-1`; `combat.c:944,983-985`):
    `bounded = raw + deathValue`, the armor share cancelling out of the
    `save + take` identity (verified per-hit exact, and the death
    broadcast shares the killing hit's demo timestamp on all 10923
    corpus deaths). Same-frame multi-hit deaths cascade the one death
    value across the frame's hits in wire (application) order, last to
    first. Two wire limits force an approximate shadow-health fallback:
    KTX clamps a corpse's health at `-99` (`combat.c:259`), and a tight
    death→respawn hides the death value behind the respawn's positive
    health (recovered from the authoritative `DeathEvent`). The
    nullification rules the wire ignores are unchanged (pent/`tp`
    mates+self bounded to armor, `tp4` to 0, all skipped for a suicide),
    read from serverinfo with `tp_num()` semantics; godmode is
    unobservable and ignored.
  - **Telefrags and stomps fold their honest damage into
    `given`/`givenTeam`/`taken`** — and nothing else. KTX's scoreboard
    accumulation has no tele/stomp exclusion (`combat.c:1046-1076`, both
    map to `wpNONE`), so our fold-free exclusion was exactly the
    corpus-visible residual — every player whose KTX `dmg.team` exceeded
    our `givenTeam` had dealt a team telefrag. A telefrag folds its
    **bounded** reconstruction (victim's full armor + remaining health —
    the wire 9999 is a kill guarantee, not a measurement) into the raw
    family too; a stomp is a real ~10 HP `T_Damage` and folds wire (raw)
    / reconstruction (bounded). Both stay out of `events`, `byWeapon`,
    `matrix`, `ewep` and `totalDamage` (KTX's `weapons[].damage`
    excludes them too); each `telefrags[]`/`stomps[]` entry now carries
    the folded `bounded`/`damage` and the `victimWep` class it landed
    in.
  - **Spawn-state inference.** A tele/stomp victim is alive by
    definition (`tdeath_touch` requires `ISLIVE`), so a non-positive
    health shadow means the respawn beat the end-of-frame stat
    broadcast: the reconstruction reads that victim from spawn state
    (100 health, no armor, spawn inventory) instead of the stale corpse
    shadow — the same wire-invisibility as the match-start spawn.
  - **Skipped modes.** `k_midair` / `k_instagib` / `k_dmgfrags` rewrite
    `take` unobservably, so bounded is skipped outright there rather
    than emitted wrong: `damage.boundedMode = "skipped:<mode>"`, no
    tele/stomp fold-in, and a `dmg=bounded` request returns the new
    `422 bounded_unavailable`.
  - **Corpus validation.** `TestBoundedReconciliationCorpus` reconciles
    the reconstruction against `demoInfo` on every corpus demo — per
    player (`given`/`taken`/`ewep`/`team`) and per weapon
    (`weapons[].damage.enemy`/`team`). The death-value model tightens the
    given/taken reconciliation ~2.5×: tolerances are re-pinned at measured
    max + headroom (given/taken/per-weapon ±40, measured 16/15/18; ewep
    ±150, measured 131; team ±10, measured 1). The remaining residuals are
    the multi-hit cascade save split, the `-99` clamp / masked-death shadow
    fallback, and — for ewep only — the victim-item one-frame window (a
    same-frame RL/LG pickup reclassifying a hit's victim-weapon bucket,
    independent of the health arithmetic). The dm3 pent-deflect
    (`Satan's power deflects nlk's telefrag`) is pinned as live coverage.
    A loose warning-mode variant landed in the diagnostic harness.
  - **REST / MCP surface.** `/damage` gains `dmg=raw|bounded|both`
    (`raw` = the byte-stable v53 shape; `both` = the stored shape;
    `bounded` = the bounded family materialized into the raw field
    names). The default (unset `dmg`) is **`bounded` for both the summary
    and the full log** — the KTX-scoreboard number a reader almost always
    wants; `raw` and `both` stay explicit opt-ins. MCP `getDamage` takes
    the same `dmg` input and forwards it, so an unadorned `getDamage`
    (MCP defaults `summary=true`) serves the bounded family. An invalid
    `dmg` is a `400 invalid_param`; an **explicit** `dmg=bounded` on a
    skipped demo is the `422 bounded_unavailable` (a new drift-tested
    error code), while a **defaulted** bounded there falls back to `raw`
    (whose `boundedMode` explains the absence) instead of erroring. The
    view-layer filtered recompute reproduces both families exactly,
    including the tele/stomp fold.
  - **KTX-exact bounded on a summary.** An unfiltered bounded/both
    **summary** now sources its per-player bounded figures — `given`,
    `givenTeam`, `givenSelf`, `ewep`, per-weapon `byWeapon` — from KTX's
    exact end-of-match scoreboard (`demoInfo.players[].dmg` +
    `weapons[].damage.enemy`) when the demo carries `demoInfo`, since the
    per-hit reconstruction is only best-effort. A new
    `boundedSource: "ktx" | "reconstructed"` field records which. The
    substitution is partial: `taken` (KTX is enemy-only; ours is
    all-sources) and the `enemyVs*` buckets (KTX has no split) stay
    reconstructed, so on a `ktx` summary they may not sum exactly to the
    substituted `given`. Filtered/windowed summaries and the full-log
    response have no KTX counterpart and stay fully reconstructed.
  - Goldens regenerate at branch end (they stay v53 until then, so the
    served-spec validation augments the fixture Result with a synthetic
    bounded family in the meantime). See
    [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md) for the
    field-level reference.

## 2026-07-12 (phase-16.2)

- **GDPR disclosure: privacy policy + terms of use on the portal (no
  schema change).** `/portal/privacy` and `/portal/terms`, linked from
  every portal page footer and acknowledged at the sign-in panel. The
  privacy policy states the audited facts: Discord `identify` scope
  only (id + username stored with the key record), keys stored as
  SHA-256 hashes shown once, strictly-necessary `/portal`-scoped
  cookies only (1 h session), access logs with best-effort IP for
  operations/abuse (kept up to one year), public hub.quakeworld.nu demos
  as the content source, Discord + hub as the only third parties, and
  the GDPR rights/contact channel. Pinned by portal tests; operator
  review notes embedded in the template.

- **RESULT_SCHEMA served standalone; portal points at the self-served
  docs; public name is mvdanalyzer-api (no schema change).**
  `GET /docs/result-schema` renders `RESULT_SCHEMA.md` (embedded from
  the mvd-analytics module root, rendered by vendored marked 12.0.2 —
  no CDN; raw markdown at `/docs/result-schema.md`; GitHub-style
  heading anchors so internal `#links` work; repo-relative links
  rewritten to GitHub). The OpenAPI spec's deep-contract link now
  points there instead of GitHub. The portal landing links `/docs`,
  `/openapi.yaml` and `/docs/result-schema`, gains a short MCP section
  (endpoint `<origin>/mcp`, no key needed, one-line client-add
  example), and keeps exactly one GitHub link (source/issues) — pinned
  by a landing-page test. The API's public name is **mvdanalyzer-api**
  (spec title, docs pages, portal); the server binary and module stay
  `mvd-api`.

- **The served OpenAPI spec is now the single per-endpoint reference;
  API.md slims to a high-level guide (docs only).** `/openapi.yaml` +
  `/docs` are self-contained — no more dead repo-file references in
  rendered descriptions (reducer registry, tele/stomp pseudo-codes, the
  artifact mapping table, the overview wall-clock formula are inlined;
  the one external link is an absolute GitHub URL to RESULT_SCHEMA.md
  for deep Result internals). API.md drops its ~700-line §4 endpoint
  reference (three-way duplication with the spec and RESULT_SCHEMA.md)
  and keeps getting-started, conventions, endpoint-choice, and recipes.
  Spec examples use a real demo (`gameId:145060` and its SHA).

- **Columnar buckets carry their own loc legend (schema v53).** The
  `/buckets` `layout=column` envelope — the REST and MCP default — gains
  `locTable`, the demo's interned loc-name table, present iff an `li`
  column is in the output. Columnar deliberately keeps the compact raw
  `li` index instead of repeating name strings per bucket, but that
  meant the default `getBuckets` handed an MCP agent undecodable
  integers and forced a `getLocTable` round trip + join. The legend
  makes columnar responses loc-self-contained; `loc=index` workflows
  and `/loc-table` are unchanged. View-shape-only change; the bump
  exists so schemaVersion-keyed immutable ETags stop revalidating
  pre-legend bodies. RESULT_SCHEMA's version-history table also gains
  the v51/v52 rows that 16.1 omitted.

- **OpenAPI 3.1 spec + `/docs` viewer; `weapons` param rename (no schema
  change).** Phase 16.2 — the REST surface now ships a machine-readable
  contract for external integrators:
  - **`GET /openapi.yaml`** serves a hand-authored OpenAPI 3.1
    description of all 35 operations with **full field-level response
    schemas**, embedded in the binary. It is pinned to the code by
    drift tests (route parity with the router in both directions,
    error-code/artifact/field-code enums, `info.version` =
    schemaVersion) and its response schemas are **validated against
    real golden-corpus responses** through the real router — ~50 cases
    covering every operation, the shape-changing param variants
    (`summary`, `layout`, `loc=index`, all field codes) and every error
    class. **`GET /docs`** is a browsable reference over it (vendored
    RapiDoc, no CDN). Both auth-exempt.
  - **`weapons` replaces the singular `weapon` query param** on
    `/frags`, `/damage`, `/backpacks`, `/weapon-pickups`. REST keeps
    `weapon` as an accepted legacy alias (canonical wins when both are
    present), so existing integrations keep working. **The MCP tool
    input field is renamed outright** (`weapon` → `weapons` on
    getFrags/getDamage/getBackpacks/getWeaponPickups) — MCP clients
    re-read schemas per session; hardcoded callers must rename.
  - Tool-description papercuts: getOverview names the winner
    (frag-sorted, index 0), getDamage/getAim lead with their MCP
    `summary=true` default and state the telefrag exclusion once, the
    items/weapon-pickups/backpacks trio cross-links its division of
    labour, and the generic-artifact operation gains the full node-name
    ↔ curated-route ↔ `resultKey` ↔ 422-code table (in the served spec).
  - Robustness fallout from the validation harness: the buckets
    first-value reducers no longer panic on empty-but-non-nil change
    streams.

## 2026-07-12 (phase-16.1)

- **Fresh-eyes review fixes: the remaining size footguns + doc drift
  (no schema change).** Two independent no-history design reviews of
  the MCP and REST surfaces (both verdicts: sound); their confirmed
  findings:
  - `getStreamSlice` now **requires a time window at the MCP layer**
    (either bound suffices; REST stays unwindowed) — an unwindowed
    slice is native-rate entries for the whole match, the exact class
    of payload the windowMs/summary defaults exist to prevent.
    `getLocTrails` defaults `minDwellMs` to **250** at the MCP layer
    (explicit `0` restores the raw stream) — raw trails are dominated
    by nearest-loc boundary flicker.
  - `/weapon-pickups` `source` is now validated like the other enum
    params: a typo (`source=backpak`) 400s with the valid values
    instead of silently matching nothing.
  - Doc truth: API.md documents the **50 ms REST `windowMs` default**
    (with a warning), the deliberate no-pagination stance, the scoped
    per-endpoint cache-header sets, the map-endpoint ETag shapes, and
    the missing `opening_unavailable` error row; the MCP README's
    `listArtifacts` section now shows the trimmed shape, the events
    default-type list includes `pickup`, and `getFrags` explains why
    its `summary` default is deliberately the opposite of its
    siblings'. `windowMs`/`minDwellMs` docs now contrast ms vs the
    seconds-typed window params in the same call.

- **listArtifacts goes routing-only at the MCP layer; timeline artifact
  gets a size warning (no schema change).** External-review follow-ups:
  `listArtifacts` now returns servable artifacts only, trimmed to
  `{name, resultKey, cost, lazy, description}` — the DAG edges and
  internal nodes stay on REST `/v1/artifacts`/`/v1/graph` where they
  serve the dev story. The `timeline` node description now warns it is
  one of the largest sections and points at the windowed views. The
  reported "opaque MCP error" regression did not reproduce: two new
  end-to-end tests (in-memory + streamable HTTP, real go-sdk client)
  pin that REST 4xx bodies — including the enumerated field-code list —
  arrive verbatim in the isError text.

- **Friction + correctness edges (schema v52,
  [PLAN-api-usability](PLAN-api-usability.md) workstream C).**
  - **No-match-start demos are flagged, not coerced (v52):** when no
    match start is detected the rebase never runs and every timestamp
    stays on the raw demo clock — previously indistinguishable from a
    rebased result. `streams.global` now carries `timeBase: "demo"`
    (omitted normally) and `errors[]` gains a matching notice, so
    `/overview` surfaces it.
  - **Unknown field codes now teach the vocabulary:** the
    `state-at`/`buckets`/`stream-slice` field error enumerates every
    valid code with a gloss (`li (location), h (health), …`). The
    classic `loc`-vs-`li` trap is also documented in the MCP tool
    schemas (the selector code is `li`; the `loc=` param picks name-
    vs-index rendering). No aliases, by decision (D6 amended).
  - **Float-artifact fix on the view envelope (D8 amended):** all view
    ms→seconds conversions now divide by 1000 (IEEE division is
    correctly rounded) instead of multiplying by the inexact `0.001`
    — `13.155000000000001` becomes `13.155` across events, trails,
    buckets, stream-slice. Values change at most one ulp; shapes
    unchanged.
  - **Doc-debt:** the stale `result/shots.go` comments claiming the
    stream is not match-gated (pre-v50) are fixed; RESULT_SCHEMA
    documents the `demoInfo` time island (KTX seconds on KTX's clock)
    and the items phase time sentinels; powerup events in the events
    view no longer echo the derivable `duration` (the Result keeps
    it); `getOverview`'s description spells out the ms-out/seconds-in
    units seam.

- **Filter + summary pass over the item/pickup endpoints and MCP-layer
  token-lean defaults (no schema change,
  [PLAN-api-usability](PLAN-api-usability.md) workstream B).**
  - `/items` gains `from`/`to` (keeps phases **overlapping** the window)
    and `summary=true` (per-item `{takenCount, byPlayer, firstTake}`
    with takes counted **inside** the window) — "who took X in the
    opening minute" no longer fetches the full-match phase timeline.
    `/backpacks` and `/weapon-pickups` gain `from`/`to` on the
    drop/pickup time. The MCP proxy now forwards `startTime`/`endTime`
    for `getRegionControl` (REST already accepted them; the proxy
    silently dropped them).
  - **MCP `windowMs` default is now 5 s (was 1 s)** for `getBuckets`
    and `getRegionControl`: a 20-min match at 1 s is ~1200 buckets per
    field per player — 5 s resolves the trend/control questions a
    bucketed timeline answers (shortest interesting run, a quad, is
    30 s) at a fifth of the payload. Pass `windowMs` explicitly for
    finer resolution; REST keeps its 50 ms default.
  - **MCP defaults diverge from REST toward token-lean (D1):**
    `getDamage`, `getAim`, and `getItems` now default `summary: true`
    at the MCP layer only — REST keeps full logs by default. A
    defaulted summary response carries a `hint` field telling the agent
    to pass `summary: false` for the dropped detail. Precedent: the
    proxy's existing `windowMs` 50→1000 override.
  - **`searchGames` goes compact and paginates honestly:** rows now
    project each roster entry to `{name, team, frags}` (the verbatim
    hub rows — per-player ping, color arrays, name_color — return with
    `roster: true`), and the response gains `total` (all matching rows,
    via PostgREST `count=exact`) alongside the page-local `count`.
    Tool descriptions now also document that `loadDemo` is optional
    (analysis tools auto-load `gameId:N` on first use).

- **The match opening becomes first-class (schema v51,
  [PLAN-api-usability](PLAN-api-usability.md) workstream A).** Three
  related changes driven by the first real hosted-MCP agent session
  (an opening-race question cost ~45 tool calls of timestamp
  cross-referencing):
  - **Initial-spawn bug fix.** KTX respawns every player when the
    countdown ends (`SM_PrepareClients` → `k_respawn`,
    ktx/src/match.c:881,972), but a player alive through the countdown
    never crosses health ≤0→>0, so the parser's dead→alive detector
    missed the first — most contested — spawn of the match. The
    timeline now synthesizes a `t=0` spawn in `streams.players[].sp`
    for every player alive at match start whose respawn wasn't
    wire-visible.
  - **`pickup` events with full identity.** `/events` (and MCP
    `getEvents`) gains a default `pickup` type joined from the
    authoritative `items` / `weaponPickups` sections:
    `detail{item (ya_1 vs ya_2), kind, entNum, loc, source
    (world/backpack/unknown), dropper?}` — "which YA / which RL pad"
    no longer needs a second call and timestamp cross-referencing.
    `spawn` events now carry `detail{loc}` when the location is
    resolvable (sampled just after the teleport landing; absent on
    maps without a .loc corpus).
  - **New `opening` artifact.** A post-processor projects each
    player's match-start spawn loc plus the first in-match take of
    every contested spawner (armors, mega, powerups, RL/LG) into
    `Result.Opening` — served via `GET /v1/demos/{id}/artifacts/opening`
    and MCP `getArtifact('opening')` with zero new tools. One small
    call per demo answers the opening-race question class.

## 2026-07-09

- **Hosted MCP is now unauthenticated (no schema change).** `mvd-mcp -http`
  no longer requires (or validates) a per-request `Authorization` key — web AI
  chat connectors can use the bare `/mcp` URL. The shim instead authenticates
  itself to `mvd-api` with an operator-issued service key (`MVD_API_KEY` env
  var), forwarded on every proxied REST call; the REST API keeps full API-key
  auth, and that one key's service rate class throttles all anonymous MCP
  traffic. A client that does present a `qwmvd_…` bearer gets it forwarded
  instead (own bucket + log identity); non-`qwmvd_` bearers (e.g. platform
  OAuth tokens) are ignored. In stdio mode `MVD_API_KEY` now also supersedes
  `-label`, so a local shim can talk to an auth-enabled `mvd-api`.

- **`getFrags` / `getDamage` (`/frags`, `/damage`): filters now narrow ALL
  aggregates + new `from`/`to` window + `summary` mode; damage output is now
  match-only (schema v50).** Changes to the frag/damage endpoints and their
  MCP tools:
  - **Filters narrow every aggregate (bug fix).** Previously a `players` /
    `weapon` filter only narrowed the per-event log and the `byPlayer` keys,
    leaving `totalFrags` / `totalDamage` / `byWeapon` / `matrix` at their
    unfiltered values — an internally inconsistent response. Now, when any
    scoping filter is active, every aggregate is **recomputed from the filtered
    log** so it matches exactly the entries shown. With no filter the
    authoritative stored totals are returned unchanged (byte-identical to
    before) — the unfiltered path is untouched. Filtered damage responses now
    also populate `matrix` / `events` (previously left null). Filtered frag
    aggregates are log-sourced and may differ from the unfiltered totals for
    reconnect / unresolved-name edge cases (documented in API.md §4.5/4.5b).
  - **`from` / `to` time window** (REST; `startTime` / `endTime` on the MCP
    tools) — match-relative **seconds**, keep only frags/hits in the window.
    The seconds→ms conversion now rounds to the nearest ms (`0.29s`→`290ms`),
    not truncating.
  - **`summary`** — drop the big per-event log and return only the aggregates
    (avoids overflowing an LLM context). Orthogonal to the filters.
  - **Damage output is now match-only (schema v50 bump).** The per-hit
    `damage.events` log is **gated to in-match at the source** (the damage
    analyzer), matching the aggregates — out-of-match (warmup / post-match)
    hits are dropped everywhere and no longer exposed. This makes the filter's
    all-players recompute reproduce the stored aggregates **exactly** (closing
    a filtered over-count where the ungated log double-counted warmup hits),
    lets the aim analysis read exactly-in-match damage (removing an approximate
    `[0,matchEnd]` self-window), and fixes a latent bug where
    `timelineAnalysis.airgibs` counted warmup / post-match rocket airgibs.
    Goldens regenerated: `damage.events` arrays shrink; some `aim` splits and
    `airgibs` lists shift on demos with out-of-match rocket hits. Frags are
    unaffected (they already gated at the analyzer).
  - **Telefrags / stomps are match-only, match-clock, and exclude team
    kills.** The `damage.telefrags` / `damage.stomps` arrays are gated to
    in-match at the source, and a **team** telefrag/stomp is no longer credited
    to the attacker's `telefrags` / `stomps` counter (mirroring the team-kill
    convention the view already applied) — so the filtered counters match the
    stored totals. Their `time` is now **match-relative ms** like
    `damage.events`: only the per-hit log was rebased before, leaving the
    positional-kill arrays on the demo clock, contradicting the schema and the
    `from`/`to` window / telefrag+stomp event lenses that compare against
    match-relative bounds. The in-match gate now keys off the match **timestamp
    range** (the detector's final start/end) rather than a live match-phase
    flag sampled per record, fixing a same-frame race: a kill on the exact
    match-start frame — decoded before the same-frame "Fight" print flipped the
    detector — was wrongly dropped, and now appears at match-relative `t=0`
    (the inclusive upper bound likewise keeps a hit on the exact match-end
    frame, which KTX itself scored). Goldens: telefrag/stomp times shift by
    `-demoOffset`; a couple of start/end-frame entries reappear with the
    counters they imply.
  - **All analytics streams are match-only now, except chat.** The `shots`
    stream is gated to in-match at the source (warmup / prewar / post-match
    fires dropped; the `Shot.warmup` field is removed — no out-of-match shot
    survives). The shots gate keys off the same match **timestamp range** as
    damage, so a fire on the exact match-start/-end frame is kept rather than
    lost to the same same-frame race. Frags, damage, telefrags/stomps, shots,
    positions, pickups, items and backpacks are all match-only; **chat is the
    deliberate exception** (pre-game talk is kept). This makes it impossible
    for a consumer to accidentally mix warmup data into match analytics.
  - **Windowing consistency + bound validation nits.** `chat` now rounds its
    `from`/`to` seconds→ms to the nearest ms like the other windowed sections
    (it truncated before, off by up to 1 ms); a windowed / players-scoped
    `aim` that matches no shooter returns `players: []`, not `null`, matching
    the filtered-empty-log convention; and the REST layer now rejects a NaN /
    Inf / negative / int32-ms-overflowing `from` / `to` / `time` with a `400
    invalid_param` instead of letting the bad float→int32 conversion silently
    filter everything behind a `200`.

- **`getAim` (`/aim`): `players` / `from` / `to` / `summary` filters (no schema
  change).** The aim endpoint and its MCP tool used to return everything
  (~70 KB), overflowing an LLM context. New query-layer filters, consistent
  with the frag/damage discipline above:
  - **`summary`** (bool) — return only the compact per-player `weapons`
    aggregates, dropping the large per-fire `crosshair` + `lgRamp` sample
    arrays. The overflow fix; recommended default for the MCP tool.
  - **`players`** (csv) — scope to named shooters. With no time window this
    selects their **match-wide** stored aim (same as `getFrags?players=`).
  - **`from` / `to`** (REST; `startTime` / `endTime` on the MCP tool) —
    match-relative **seconds**. Setting a window **recomputes** aim over the
    shots in it, so every figure (weapons accuracy, RL/GL direct/splash, LG
    ramp, crosshair samples) scopes to the window consistently. With no window
    the stored aim is returned unchanged (no recompute).
  - **Refactor: the aim computation core moved to package `aimcore`**
    (`aimcore.Compute`), imported by both the analyzer (fills `res.Aim` once)
    and the view layer (windowed variants) without an import cycle. The stored
    aim is **byte-identical** to before (goldens unchanged) — the extraction
    preserved behaviour exactly. No schema bump (`CurrentSchemaVersion` stays
    50); the `AimResult` struct is untouched.

## 2026-07-08

- **Fix: cold demo loads failed with a 502 `hub_upstream` hash mismatch.** The hub's `demo_sha256` is the hash of the *uncompressed* `.mvd`, but the CDN serves gzip and the phase-3 integrity check hashed the gzipped download — so every un-cached `loadDemo`/`POST /v1/demos/{id}` was rejected. The check now authenticates the *decompressed* content (or a raw `.mvd` fallback) against `demo_sha256`; corruption is still rejected. mvd-api change; redeploy it.

- **mvd-mcp: array/map tool filters fixed (`players`, `fields`, `types`, `weapon`, `items`, `kinds`, `reducers`).** jsonschema-go reflected every nilable slice/map to a `["null", X]` type union; some MCP clients coerce a union to a string, silently disabling those filters. Tool input schemas now advertise a plain `{"type":"array"}`/`{"type":"object"}` (null stripped). No API/output change; rebuild+redeploy `mvd-mcp` and reconnect the client to pick up the new schemas.

- **mvd-mcp over streamable HTTP + deploy templates (no schema change;
  transport/auth layer).** The MCP shim gains a hosted mode; stdio is unchanged.
  - **`mvd-mcp -http ADDR`.** Serves MCP over streamable HTTP (go-sdk
    `NewStreamableHTTPHandler`, Stateless) instead of stdio, for hosting the
    service publicly. Empty `-http` keeps today's stdio behaviour byte-identical;
    the two transports are mutually exclusive. No new dependencies.
  - **Per-request API-key auth.** Every MCP request must carry
    `Authorization: Bearer qwmvd_…`. An outer gate validates the key against
    `mvd-api`'s `GET /v1/auth/check` (fail-closed; `401` + `WWW-Authenticate:
    Bearer` otherwise) — this single gate also protects the `searchGames` tool,
    which bypasses `mvd-api`. On success the key is forwarded on every proxied
    REST call, so `mvd-api` stays the single point of validation; a key revoked
    mid-session stops working on the next call. `-label` is ignored in HTTP
    mode. The handler is mounted at `/mcp` (and `/mcp/`), with an
    unauthenticated `GET /healthz`.
  - **Deploy templates (`deploy/`).** A `Caddyfile` (TLS, `/mcp*` → mvd-mcp,
    rest → mvd-api, real-client-IP `X-Forwarded-For`), `mvd-api.service` /
    `mvd-mcp.service` systemd units (hardened, secrets via `EnvironmentFile`),
    and a provisioning `README.md` runbook with a smoke-test checklist. Tracked
    templates, not run by CI.
  - **Documented omission.** `/los`, `/shots`, `/streams/*`, and `/airgibs`
    still have no curated MCP tool (adding them is deferred); noted in the
    mvd-mcp README.

- **mvd-api Discord key portal + key-store cross-process lock (no schema
  change; transport/auth layer).** Optional, off by default — nothing changes
  for existing localhost users, and analytics output is untouched.
  - **The portal (`internal/portal`).** With `-portal -portal-base-url URL`
    (plus `-auth-dir` and the `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` / `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` /
    `PORTAL_COOKIE_SECRET` env vars), the server serves a one-page portal at
    `/portal` where a user signs in with Discord (OAuth2 scope `identify` only)
    and self-services one API key. `POST /portal/key` shows the full key once
    and revokes any prior key for that user. Without `-portal`, the `/portal`
    routes are not registered at all (they 404) and the server is unchanged.
  - **Session security.** The only server-trusted state is a 1-hour
    HMAC-SHA256-signed session cookie (no server-side store); the OAuth `state`
    nonce is double-submitted against a signed cookie (CSRF); all cookies are
    `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/portal`. The Discord username
    is HTML-escaped (`html/template`), and neither the cookie secret nor the
    Discord client secret ever reaches a log line, error body, or page. The
    portal adds **no new dependencies** (stdlib `net/http` OAuth, `crypto/hmac`,
    `html/template`, `embed`). Cookie `Secure` follows the `-portal-base-url`
    scheme — `https` ⇒ Secure (production), `http` ⇒ non-Secure (local dev
    only, since a browser will not send a Secure cookie over http); the server
    logs a startup warning whenever cookies are non-Secure.
  - **Key store cross-process lock.** `internal/authkeys` mutations
    (`Issue`/`Revoke`) now take a cross-process `flock` and reload `keys.json`
    under the lock before writing, so the portal (issuing inside the live
    server) and a concurrent `keys` CLI can no longer clobber each other's
    writes. Reads stay lock-free. A new `ActiveByDiscordID` accessor backs the
    portal's key-status display.
  - **Deferred (manual, needs an operator-provisioned Discord app):** the
    end-to-end run against the real Discord OAuth flow. CI proves the flow with
    an httptest Discord stub.

- **mvd-api API keys + auth middleware (no schema change; transport/auth
  layer).** Optional, off by default — nothing changes for existing localhost
  users, and analytics output is untouched.
  - **Two modes.** Without `-auth-dir` the server is unauthenticated, exactly
    as before (the `Authorization: Bearer <label>` value stays a non-secret
    access-log tag). With `-auth-dir DIR`, every `/v1/*` route and
    `POST /v1/demos/{id}` requires `Authorization: Bearer qwmvd_…`; missing /
    invalid / revoked keys get a generic `401` + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`.
    Exempt: `/healthz`, `/v1/version`, `/portal/*`, and `OPTIONS` preflight
    (CORS answers preflight before auth, so browsers are unaffected).
  - **Key store.** New `internal/authkeys`: one atomic-written `keys.json`
    holding only SHA-256 hashes of keys (`qwmvd_` + 32 random bytes,
    base64url). The plaintext key is shown once at issuance and never
    persisted; lookups are constant-time hash compares. One active key per
    Discord user (re-issuing revokes the prior one).
  - **`keys` CLI.** `mvd-api keys issue|revoke|list -auth-dir DIR` manages the
    store directly; `list` shows hash prefixes + metadata, never a full key or
    hash.
  - **Per-key rate limiting.** Token bucket per key hash (stdlib, no new
    dependency), split into `user` and looser `service` classes
    (`-rate-user`/`-burst-user`, `-rate-service`/`-burst-service`); over-limit
    → `429` + `Retry-After`. This closes the rate-limit half of the F15
    throttle by keying on the validated API key rather than the spoofable IP.
  - **`GET /v1/auth/check`** → `204` for a live key, `401` otherwise (key
    self-test; also the MCP-HTTP pre-validation hook).
  - **Secret safety.** In auth mode the raw key is never logged — the access
    log's identity becomes the key's note / Discord name / hash-prefix. The
    `401`/`429` bodies are generic and leak nothing about key state.
  - **Hardening.** `-auth-dir` is force-tightened to `0700` on open (so a
    pre-existing loose dir can't leave key metadata world-listable), a corrupt
    `keys.json` fails loudly at startup rather than presenting an empty store,
    auth exemptions are path-cleaned (no `/portal/..`-style traversal past the
    key gate), and an unknown top-level subcommand now errors instead of
    silently booting a server (`serve` is still the default).

- **Analytics pipeline: the core/derived/post-processor "tiers" are collapsed
  into one task model (no schema bump, `Result` byte-identical).** The tiers
  were a pre-DAG remnant — once the topological sort over declared
  `Requires`/`Provides` edges took over ordering, the tier label no longer
  drove anything. `RegisterCore`/`RegisterDerived` merge into a single
  `Register`; every node is now just a task with declared edges, differing only
  in whether it reads events (analyzer) or only refines the assembled `Result`
  (post-processor), plus the one lazy node (`los`). API-visible changes, both
  in the DAG-introspection surface only (not demo analytics):
  - `GET /v1/artifacts` manifest entries **no longer carry `tier`** — the only
    real distinction it conflated (lazy vs eager) is already the `lazy` flag.
  - `GET /v1/graph` nodes **replace `tier` with `depth`** (the node's layer in
    the dependency DAG), and `qw-analyze -graph mermaid` now groups nodes into
    depth layers instead of tier subgraphs (`los` marked with a dashed outline).
  - `ARTIFACTS.md` drops its `Tier` column (regenerated).

## 2026-07-07

- **mvd-api hosting-prep hardening (no schema change; transport/ops
  hardening).** Prerequisites for exposing the API publicly; nothing in
  the analytics output changes.
  - **Cache quota + GC.** New `-cache-max-bytes` (default 20 GiB; `0`
    disables). A background sweep evicts the oldest tier-1 MVDs, tier-2
    gobs and tier-3 artifact gobs (ordered by mtime, bumped on every
    cache hit — atime is unreliable on relatime/noatime mounts) once the
    disk budget is exceeded, never blocking the request path. Startup
    deletes tier-2 trees orphaned by past schema/format bumps (including
    legacy suffix-less `v<N>` trees), stale-version tier-3 gobs (also the
    retired `shot-streams@*` ones), and stale atomic-write temp files.
    New `mvd-api cache stats` and `mvd-api cache prune [-max-bytes |
    -older-than | -all]` ops subcommands.
  - **Parse throttle.** New `-max-parses` (default `max(1, NumCPU/2)`): a
    semaphore bounds concurrent heavy cold operations so a storm of
    distinct cold demos can't spawn unbounded parallel work. It covers
    both the cold download+parse and the on-demand LOS raycast (no schema
    change), closing the unauthenticated-CPU-exhaustion path on
    `/los`/`/artifacts/los`. Cache hits are unaffected; rate limiting
    proper arrives with API keys. `cache prune` gains `-dry-run` and
    rejects the silent no-op `-max-bytes 0`.
  - **Capped hub reads.** Demo downloads (CDN and `demo_source_url`) are
    read through a 64 MiB `io.LimitReader`, so a broken or hostile
    upstream can't OOM the process; over-cap responses are upstream
    errors (`502`), never `404`.
  - **CORS.** Permissive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with
    `Expose-Headers` (ETag/X-Cache/X-Schema-Version/X-Request-Id) and
    `OPTIONS` preflight, so browser clients on any origin can call the
    API (API.md §2.6).
  - **Error hygiene.** Every response carries `X-Request-Id`; `5xx`
    bodies are now a generic message + that id (the real error, which can
    embed cache paths / upstream URLs, goes to the server log only) —
    covering the curated endpoints, the generic artifact endpoint, and
    panics (the `panic` error code folds into `internal`). `4xx` messages
    stay specific. Also: `POST /v1/demos/{id}` no longer carries
    `Cache-Control`/`ETag`; error bodies no longer carry a stray `ETag`;
    `/los` and `/artifacts/los` return `{"players":[]}` (not `null`) when
    a demo has no streams; `/v1/maps/{map}/entities` now honours
    case-insensitive `types`/`kinds` param names.

- **API: the spatial weapon-fire streams are now built on every parse instead
  of behind a lazy re-parse (no schema bump, response bodies unchanged).**
  mvd-api parses each demo with `BuildShotStreams`+`BuildNails` on
  (`internal/democache` `defaultParse`), so the projectile/beam/nail streams and
  the stream-enriched `shots`/`aim` blocks are baked into the cached `Result`.
  This costs ~+3–4% parse time and ~+5% cache size and **deletes** the lazy
  `shot-streams` artifact, its full second parse on first request (2.4–5 s), the
  two-state Shots/Aim, the degrade path, and the shipped caching bug it caused.
  Behavioural notes for callers:
  - **`/shots`, `/aim`, `/streams/{projectiles,beams,nails}` no longer pay a
    second parse on the first request** — they are plain reads off the base
    Result. Their bodies are byte-identical to before for a warm enriched demo
    (mvd-api has served the enriched bodies on every request since phase 5.3).
  - **The `X-Shot-Streams: unavailable` degrade header (and its
    `Cache-Control: no-store`) is removed.** There is no rebuild that can fail on
    evicted bytes anymore. Callers that sniffed the header should stop.
  - **Local API caches re-parse each demo once.** The tier-2 path gained an
    internal cache-format suffix (`results/v<N>f2/…`, `resultCacheFormat` in
    `internal/democache/paths.go`) so lean pre-phase-12 gobs are never served as
    full; they are ignored and re-parsed on next touch. No schema bump — the
    ETag stays `"<sha>-v49"`. Stale `shot-streams@*.gob` tier-3 side-gobs are
    inert until the hosting-prep GC reaps them.
  - `los` is untouched: it stays a genuinely lazy tier-3 artifact (its ~2.5 s
    raycast has no in-pipeline consumer). The generic artifact endpoint, the DAG
    manifest, `-graph`, `ARTIFACTS.md`, and the mvd-mcp `getArtifact` vocabulary
    drop `shot-streams` (now 22 nodes, 1 lazy).
- **Web: the WASM parse now also builds nails (`BuildNails`), so the nail map
  overlay lights up automatically and the Aim tab gains ng/sng rows** (generic
  `shots`/`hits`/`hit %` columns — nail accuracy is approximate, so no
  direct/splash split). Adds ~+3–4% to the in-browser parse, no extra download.

- **Internal: the two fix-up post-processors now produce named FINAL
  artifacts instead of anonymously patching an earlier node (DAG contract
  clarification, no schema bump, byte-identical output).** Telefrag-teamkill
  recovery (node renamed `recover-telefrag-teamkills` → **`frags-final`**,
  publishing artifact **`frags:final`**) still appends the recovered kills to
  the raw `frag` log; scoreboard-stats (node renamed `scoreboard-stats` →
  **`match-final`**, publishing **`match:final`**) still folds the corrected
  kills/deaths/suicides into `match`. The win is the dependency vocabulary:
  `match-final` now **requires `frags:final`** (not the raw `frag`), so any
  future in-pipeline consumer of the recovered log or corrected scoreboard
  binds it by the semantic `:final` name and can never silently get the
  pre-fix-up value. The raw `frag` / `match` nodes keep their served
  `frags` / `match` resultKeys (the JSON is final by serve time since all
  nodes run); the `timeline` node deliberately stays a consumer of the RAW
  `frag` log (streaks / kill events are built pre-recovery, matching every
  golden). Both fix-ups still write in place, so both keep `Mutates:true` —
  the `:final` artifact name is what disambiguates *which* value. Regenerated
  [`ARTIFACTS.md`](mvd-analytics/ARTIFACTS.md) and the README DAG diagram; the
  `/v1/artifacts`, `/v1/graph`, and `-graph` surfaces (unmerged phase branches
  only) show the new names. No Result/schema change.

- **Internal: analyzer output is now a tested pure function of the demo
  (order-independence hardening, no schema bump).** The pipeline is an
  explicit DAG (`analyzer/dag.go`) executed in a topological order whose
  tie-break froze the legacy registration order; that made order-freedom a
  believed-but-unenforced property. It is now enforced: `Result.Errors`
  (previously appended in execution order — stream abort, then per-node
  Finalize / post-processor failures) is canonicalised at the end of
  `analyzeSource` (stream-abort entry first, then lexicographic), and a new
  `TestOrderIndependence` runs representative corpus demos under the default
  order plus seeded-random valid topological orders and asserts the
  marshalled Result is byte-identical — which also continuously verifies the
  declared edge list is complete (an undeclared cross-node read shows up as
  a byte diff). An opt-in `TestPhaseTimingsReport` (`MVDA_TIMINGS=1`)
  aggregates per-node timings and reports the DAG critical path vs the
  serial Finalize+post tail. Diagnostics only; goldens are unchanged.

- **API: automatic artifact surface — the DAG is now self-describing and
  generically servable (additive endpoints, no schema bump).** The analyzer
  DAG is exposed as data (`analyzer.ArtifactManifest`), and mvd-api gains three
  additive routes: `GET /v1/artifacts` (the manifest — every node's name, tier,
  cost, `lazy`, requires/provides, `resultKey`, `servable`, description; static,
  ETag `"artifacts-v<n>"`), `GET /v1/graph` (the DAG as `{nodes,edges}`, static),
  and `GET /v1/demos/{id}/artifacts/{name}` — a generic accessor that
  materialises and serves any servable artifact by name. The generic endpoint is
  a closed registry (unknown/internal names → `404 artifact_unknown`; no user
  input reaches the filesystem beyond the validated name), accepts **no** query
  params (parameterised reads stay the view endpoints → `400 invalid_param`), and
  carries a finer per-artifact ETag `"<sha>-<name>@v<n>"`; eager artifacts reuse
  the curated 422-vs-200 availability convention, the two lazy artifacts route
  through `EnsureLOS`/`EnsureShotStreams` (same degrade + bodies as `/los`,
  `/shots`). mvd-mcp gains two matching tools — `listArtifacts` and
  `getArtifact` — so a **new** analytics artifact becomes reachable everywhere
  with zero new hand-written endpoints or tools; the curated tools/endpoints stay
  the ergonomic surface and are byte-unchanged. New generated catalog
  [`mvd-analytics/ARTIFACTS.md`](mvd-analytics/ARTIFACTS.md)
  (`make artifacts-md`, drift-tested). Per-deployment Heavy-disable knob deferred.
  No schema bump.

- **API: lazy artifacts (LOS, shot-streams) now persist across restarts and
  cache evictions — new tier-3 per-artifact cache (no schema change).** The two
  hand-rolled lazy passes are generalised into the DAG engine as `lazy` nodes
  (`los`, `shot-streams`), registered by name behind one `LazyArtifact`
  registry (`analyzer/materialize.go`) and shown in a fourth `-graph` tier.
  mvd-api gains a third cache tier — `artifacts/<sha[:2]>/<sha>/<name>@v<EV>.gob`
  — so a lazy compute (the multi-second LOS raycast, or the full MVD re-parse
  behind `/shots`, `/aim`, `/streams/*`) is written to disk on first request
  and spliced back on later ones, surviving a process restart or an LRU
  eviction (closes API follow-up F8b). Both `EnsureLOS` (new) and
  `EnsureShotStreams` run one generic flow: latch → tier-3 load → else compute
  → write tier-3, serialised per demo SHA. The F12 single-variant shot-stream
  rebuild and the `X-Shot-Streams: unavailable` degrade are preserved exactly
  — the degrade now fires only when *both* the tier-3 artifact and the tier-1
  bytes are absent. `/los`, `/shots`, `/aim`, `/streams/*` are byte-identical
  from a client's view (status, bodies, ETags, `X-Cache`). `EV` is the current
  schema version, so a schema bump invalidates tier 3 exactly like tier 2. No
  schema bump.

- **Analytics: team labels born correct; the whole-Result duel rewrite is
  gone (no schema change, byte-identical output).** A new `roster` core
  node (the last core node) owns the canonical player/team table with the
  duel (player-name-as-team) rewrite folded in: it publishes the duel
  verdict, the participant set, and `TeamFor(name, rawTeam)`. Every
  producer stamps its final team label through `co.TeamFor` at emission —
  streams, timeline events, messages, item/weapon/backpack pickups, and
  the shot fire log (whose victim-kind classification is now duel-aware at
  birth, so the shared-colour-team enemy/team fold happens once, correctly,
  instead of being reclassified afterwards). The two result-restructuring
  duties move to the analyzers that own those results: the DemoInfo team
  rewrite into `RosterAnalyzer`, and the `Match.Players` participant
  rebuild — including the demoinfo-authoritative merge that recovers a
  teamless frogbot the spectator gate drops — into `MatchAnalyzer`. The
  `normalizeDuelTeams` post-processor (which had to enumerate every
  team-labelled field by hand and grew four more sections in v45/v46) and
  the `isDuelResult` helper are deleted; `DamageAnalyzer` reads the duel
  verdict from the roster it already used at birth. The `teams:final` DAG
  barrier retires with it. Verified byte-identical on the golden corpus
  (the three 1on1 goldens are the referees); the shared-colour and bot
  duels the corpus lacks are pinned by ported unit tests.

## 2026-07-06

- **Analytics: timestamps born match-relative; the whole-Result time
  rebase is gone (no schema change, byte-identical output).** A new
  `clock` core node owns the match time base (match start/end, demo
  offset, pauses, wall-clock anchor — absorbing the old
  demo-start-anchor pass). Every producer converts demo-clock ms to
  match-relative ms against `co.Clock` in its own Finalize, so the
  `normalizeMatchRelativeTimes` post-processor — which had to enumerate
  every timestamped field by hand and silently missed newly added ones
  (the v48 killEvents bug) — is deleted, along with
  `deriveDemoStartAnchor`. The `epoch:match` DAG barrier retires with
  it. Verified byte-identical on the golden corpus and on off-corpus
  demos including pause-carrying and reconnect demos.
- **Analytics pipeline: explicit dependency DAG + `qw-analyze -graph`
  (no schema change).** The analyzer/post-processor execution order was
  previously implicit — four different mechanisms expressed ordering and
  only one was checked, so a wrong registration order was a silent data
  bug. Each node now declares the artifacts it Requires and Provides
  (`mvd-analytics/analyzer/dag.go`); `NewDefaultRegistry` validates the
  wiring at construction (every dependency has exactly one provider, no
  cycles — a typo panics with a message naming the offending artifact and
  node) and derives the execution order from it with a deterministic
  topological sort. The derived order is byte-identical to the historical
  registration order (asserted by a structural test), so the `Result` is
  unchanged. New `qw-analyze -graph mermaid` / `-graph json` prints the
  pipeline DAG (nodes, edges, tiers) without needing a demo.
- **Web Aim Stats: LG Unresolved column, accurate hover on narrow
  layouts, DYaw sign docs (no schema change).**
  - The LG table gains an `Unresolved` column (whiffs no beam matched), so
    the LG miss classes visibly sum to shots − hits instead of silently
    falling short.
  - The crosshair-density hover now maps cursor position through the
    rendered/intrinsic size ratio, and the image keeps its aspect ratio
    when a narrow panel shrinks it — previously the reported bin (and its
    shot/hit counts) drifted and the bitmap distorted horizontally.
  - The schema docs for `crosshair.dyaw` had the sign convention backwards
    ("right positive"); positive is enemy-left (Quake yaw grows
    counterclockwise). The web's plotting flip was already correct; the
    docs now match it. SSG crosshair samples remain deliberately
    unrendered (SG + LG panels only).
- **mvd-api: deterministic /shots + /aim responses; panic-proof demo
  loading (no schema change).**
  - The shot-stream rebuild now builds projectiles, beams and nails in a
    single variant. Previously nails were a separate server-side latch:
    after any client passed `?nails=1`, plain `GET /shots` and `GET /aim`
    served nail-linked bodies under the same immutable ETag — and reverted
    after an LRU eviction. Responses are now a pure function of the URL.
    The `/shots` `nails` parameter is deprecated (accepted and ignored);
    ng/sng fires were always included, and their flight-linking + accuracy
    now always is too.
  - A panicking demo parse no longer releases concurrent requests for the
    same demo with a nil result and nil error (a cascade of confusing
    nil-dereference 500s); all callers now receive a real error and the
    panic stack is logged.
- **Aim/shots correctness batch (schema v49; value fixes, no shape
  change).** Four fixes from the deferred aim/shots review:
  - The Aim tab's RL/GL direct/splash/missed split now appears on every
    default parse. It was accidentally gated on the opt-in
    `streams.projectiles` payload, which is emission-only — the projectile
    linking the split actually needs runs on every parse, so the block was
    absent everywhere except `-include projectiles` runs.
  - Warmup and post-match damage no longer leaks into those splits: the
    damage records feeding aim's pellet and direct counters are windowed
    to match time, so a warmup direct rocket no longer inflates `direct`
    and deflates `splash`.
  - Duels where both players share a colour team (e.g. both "green") no
    longer classify every hit on the opponent as team damage. Damage is
    classified duel-aware at birth, restoring airgibs, the aim enemy
    splits, the damage matrix, `victimWep` and the EWep buckets on such
    demos — all previously empty or folded into `givenTeam`.
  - Shots player identity uses the canonical slot resolver, backfilling
    a missing team from the demoinfo name table like damage/frags do.
  - A player who reconnects after the match ends no longer shows 0 frags
    on the corrected scoreboard: the server re-initializes the returning
    slot with `svc_updatefrags 0` during intermission, which clobbered the
    tracked final score (v48's removal of the 0-frag filter had surfaced
    these corrupted zeros — previously the same players were silently
    missing from `match.players` altogether). Frag tracking now freezes at
    match end; mid-match reconnects were already safe because KTX
    re-asserts the restored count itself.
  - Doc drift cleanup: the LG fire signal is `TE_LIGHTNING2` beams
    (`source: "beam"`), not the never-shipped "ammo" detection; rl/gl
    fires are linked, not "left unlinked"; `Dist` is muzzle-based.
  - The structural invariant test now covers every event-carrying result
    section (shots, damage, messages, frags, pickups, backpacks, item
    phases, aim) — not just `timelineAnalysis`.

## 2026-07-05

- **Web: chat shows every authentic message (no schema change).** The chat
  panel silently dropped any message whose exact text repeated within three
  seconds. The wire-level duplication that filter targeted (KTX sprints each
  say once per recipient at one wire timestamp) is already collapsed upstream
  by the analyzer's exact-key dedupe, so the web filter was only swallowing
  authentic repeats — a re-sent bind, two identical obituaries in quick
  succession. Removed; only the match-window clip remains.
- **Single obituary parser; timeline frag weapon codes corrected (no schema
  change).** The obituary/suicide pattern table lived twice — once for the
  frag log (`frags`), once for the timeline message stream
  (`messages.events[type=frag]`) — and the two had drifted. The timeline copy
  is now generated from the same table the frag log uses, so for the affected
  obituary lines the timeline stream's `weapon` now matches `frags[]` exactly.
  Consumer-visible corrections in `messages.events` (the frag log was already
  correct):
  - drowning self-kills now carry weapon `water` (was `drown`), matching the
    documented FragEntry vocabulary;
  - the unknown-cause self-kill "X somehow becomes bored with life" is now
    `suicide` (was mislabelled `rl` by the shorter-substring fallthrough);
  - CRMod obituaries ("blown to chunks", "shish-kebabed", "disembowled",
    "gets intimate", "warm fuzzy feeling") and KTX `k_spawnicide` self-kills
    ("shiny spawn point", "baby factory", "poor life choices") now produce a
    timeline frag event instead of being dropped or mislabelled.
  These lines are rare (env/CRMod/spawnicide), so the golden corpus output is
  byte-identical; the fix is verified by unit tests. Internal cleanup in the
  same change: one canonical slot→identity resolver (`ResolveSlotAt`) replaces
  five drifted per-analyzer copies, and one `parseInfoString` helper replaces
  three duplicated serverinfo walkers.

- **One entity-delta wire-layout implementation; FTE parse fixes (no
  schema change).** The parser's entity-baseline and entity-delta
  layouts each had a decode copy and a separate byte-skip copy that had
  drifted apart; they are now a single reader each (`readBaselineBody`
  for the baseline body, `readDeltaBits` + `readEntityDelta` for the
  delta), and `svc_spawnstatic` / `svc_fte_spawnstatic2` decode through
  that same code and discard rather than re-skipping by hand. Three
  FTE-only divergences between the old copies are fixed by construction
  to match ezquake (`cl_ents.c`) and mvdsv (`sv_ents.c`): the FTE
  "evenmorebits" byte is read only when an FTE extension was negotiated
  (the `svc_fte_spawnbaseline2` / `svc_fte_spawnstatic2` path previously
  read it unconditionally, misaligning a non-FTE stream), and the
  transparency / colour-mod fields are gated on the negotiated
  `FTE_PEXT_TRANS` / `FTE_PEXT_COLOURMOD` (previously consumed on the
  flag bit alone). Only demos that negotiated FTE entity extensions are
  affected — none exist in the golden corpus, which stays byte-identical,
  so the schema is unchanged (v48).

- **Dev-CLI correctness fixes (no schema change).**
  - `qw-analyze -view state-at -time 0` (and `-time 0s`) now queries match
    start instead of erroring with "requires -time"; flag presence is
    tracked separately from the zero value.
  - `mapgen` now fails the run when its `-demos` directory can't be walked
    (e.g. a typo'd path) instead of silently emitting an unpruned corpus,
    matching the existing `-bsp-dir` behaviour.

- **mvd-api / mvd-mcp hardening for hosted use (no schema change; REST
  surface semantics + one MCP tool-schema change).** Prerequisites for
  running the API/MCP on the internet for third-party apps:
  - **Downloaded demo bytes are verified against their SHA before
    caching.** A cold download now hashes the `.mvd.gz` bytes and rejects
    them as `hub_upstream` (502) if they don't match the hub-claimed
    `demo_sha256` that keys the cache, the `sha:` address, and the ETag —
    a corrupted CDN object can no longer poison the cache permanently.
  - **Hub "not found" is classified by error identity, not message
    text.** A new `hubfetch.ErrNotFound` sentinel + `errors.Is` replaces
    two `strings.Contains(err, "not found")` checks, so a hub 5xx whose
    body merely contains "not found" is now correctly a 502 (was
    misreported as `demo_not_found` 404).
  - **Model-supplied `demoId` is validated + escaped in the MCP proxy.**
    All demo-scoped tool calls route through a `demoPath` helper that
    rejects anything but a canonical `gameId:N` / `sha:HEX` and
    PathEscapes it, so an id containing `/`, `?`, or `#` can no longer
    reroute a request to a different endpoint.
  - **Per-demo lazy computes no longer serialize globally.** `/los` and
    the on-demand shot-stream rebuild (`/shots`, `/aim`, `/streams/*`)
    now lock per demo SHA (shared `KeyedMutex` helper) instead of one
    server-wide mutex each, so a request for demo B does not queue behind
    demo A's multi-second pass. (Disk persistence of the computed
    artifacts is deliberately out of scope here.)
  - **Cache correctness nits.** A resolved-`GameInfo` map entry that
    previously leaked for process life when a demo was served from a
    warm tier is now drained unconditionally; `GetResult` documents that
    a cold fetch runs its hub download + parse to completion regardless
    of the caller's context (the singleflight shares one computation, so
    the first caller's cancellation must not poison the others).
  - **The stream-enriched endpoints signal a degrade instead of serving
    silently-incomplete data.** When the tier-1 MVD bytes are missing so
    the opt-in weapon-fire streams can't be rebuilt, `/shots`, `/aim`,
    and `/streams/*` now set `X-Shot-Streams: unavailable` (+
    `Cache-Control: no-store`) rather than quietly returning the lean
    result.
  - **MCP tool-schema change:** `getBackpacks`'s `weapon` input is now a
    `string[]` set (forwarded as CSV), matching REST `/backpacks` since
    v36 (was a single string); `getEvents`'s `types` schema now lists the
    opt-in `damage` / `telefrag` / `stomp` kinds.
  - **Docs:** API.md's `/overview` example is corrected to int32
    milliseconds (the code has emitted ms since v24) with an added §2.1
    units row; the §2.4 error table gains `shots_unavailable` /
    `aim_unavailable`; and stale `schemaVersion: 36` examples are updated
    to 48.

- **Clean end-of-demo, and truncated demos become visible (no schema
  change).** The standard MVD termination — `svc_disconnect
  "EndOfDemo"` — now surfaces through `events.Source.Next` as `io.EOF`
  (the value the Source contract always promised) instead of a hard
  error the analytics registry silently swallowed; any tail events in
  that final message are drained before EOF. A *non*-EOF `Next` error
  (a truncated or corrupt stream) now records `"event stream aborted:
  …"` into `result.errors`, and a failed region-control pass records
  `"region control: …"` there too, so a partial parse is
  distinguishable from a clean one. Previously-ignored read/skip errors
  inside the parser (sound/baseline/download skips, serverdata movevars,
  entity-diff emits) now propagate instead of silently misaligning the
  decode cursor, and a truncated known command is reported as
  `parse_error` naming the command rather than `unknown_svc`. No value
  changes on well-formed demos — the golden corpus is byte-identical
  (its `EndOfDemo` message carries no tail events); the new `errors`
  entries appear only on broken demos, so the schema version is
  unchanged (v48).

- **Timeline, scoreboard and duel-detection correctness fixes (schema
  v48).** Five bugs in already-emitted values, no field-shape change:
  - **Kill events were on the wrong clock and mislabeled in duels.**
    `timelineAnalysis.killEvents` shipped demo-relative (each kill
    ~`demoOffset`, typically ~10 s, later than the matching
    `deathEvents`) and, in 1v1s, tagged with a raw colour team like
    `"red"` instead of the player name — the two post-processors that
    rebase time and rewrite duel teams both skipped it. The Timeline
    per-player drill-down plots `killEvents − deathEvents` on one axis,
    so every kill drew displaced and duel team colours were wrong. Now
    `killEvents` is match-relative and duel-team-labelled exactly like
    its sibling streams. A new structural invariant test over the golden
    corpus enforces this for *every* timeline event stream, so a future
    field that forgets a post-processor fails loudly instead of shipping
    wrong.
  - **A chat line could start or end the match.** Match-start/-end
    detection scanned every print for substrings like "go!" / "game
    over", including player chat: a pre-match "go go go!" started
    recording warmup, a mid-match "gg game over" froze every stat and
    stream for the rest of the demo. Chat prints (level 3) are now
    ignored for match timing; only broadcast prints move the match
    window. The obituary parser likewise rejects chat-level prints, so a
    say containing " rides " can't inject a phantom frag.
  - **CRMod super-shotgun kills were mislabeled.** "X eats 2 scoops of
    Y's lead shot" was matched by the generic grenade " eats " pattern
    first, so the kill came out as weapon `gl` with a phantom killer
    "2 scoops of Y". It is now correctly `ssg` with killer Y.
  - **0-frag players no longer vanish; team games aren't mistaken for
    duels.** A player who legitimately finished on exactly 0 frags was
    dropped from `match.players`/`match.teams`. That is fixed
    (surface-authoritative-data), and duel detection now trusts
    `demoInfo.players` as authoritative — so a 2on2 in which two players
    end on 0 frags is no longer misread as a 1v1 and team-renamed.
    To keep actual spectators from leaking in once the 0-frag filter is
    gone, the reader now parses the server-set `*spectator` userinfo
    star key (mvdsv strips the client's bare `spectator` key before
    broadcast, so the old bare-key check never matched in MVDs) and
    recomputes the flag on every full userinfo update the way ezquake
    does, so a slot reused after a spectator disconnects doesn't
    inherit a stale flag.
  - **Consistent powerup interval end times.** On a demo cut before
    intermission, quad/pent/ring runs were closed at each player's last
    position sample while weapon intervals closed at the global last
    sample; both now use one shared effective match end.

- **Crosshair placement plots in true Quake units.** The Aim Stats
  density images and yaw/pitch marginals plotted hull-normalized error
  (each axis divided by the target's angular half-extent), so one x
  unit was ~16-23 qu while one y unit was 28 qu, and the "hull" box
  drew as a square. Both now plot the offset in Quake units at the
  target's range (derived from the existing `dyaw`/`dpitch`/`dist`
  columns — no schema change), the axes share one scale, and the
  solid outlined box is the player's collision box true to shape (32
  wide × 56 tall), with a dashed outline at its corner-on silhouette
  (~45 qu wide — the axis-aligned box reads √2 wider viewed
  diagonally). Extents ±96 qu × ±64 qu, ticks every hull-width (32
  qu), hover read-outs and histogram bins in qu.

- **LG whiff split reclassified: miss / blocked / far (schema v47).**
  The split classified from the beam endpoint only, so every beam that
  stopped on geometry short of its ~600u max range counted as `blocked`
  — including shafts fired into a wall with nobody behind them, which
  made Blocked % implausibly high. Now a whiff only counts as blocked
  or out of range when the shooter was on target: `blocked` = the beam
  stopped short on geometry and its extension to full range crosses a
  live enemy's collision hull (in range — the obstruction denied a
  would-be hit); `outOfRange` = the beam ran its full length and its
  extension to infinity crosses a live enemy's hull (denied by reach);
  `miss` = every other whiff, a plain aim error with no enemy on the
  beam's line (shares the `miss` field with the SG/SSG pellet split). The
  endpoint-proximity `nearMiss` field is **removed** — with blocked
  detection on the beam line, the near/wide distinction among aim
  errors carried no signal. The Aim Stats LG table now shows Miss /
  Blocked / Far (+ share-of-fires %) with reworded tooltips. Only
  beam-enriched parses are affected (the split needs `streams.beams`),
  so the golden corpus is untouched.

## 2026-07-04

- **Timeline frag/death events no longer dropped for players with no
  resolvable team.** `timelineAnalysis.fragEvents` and `.deathEvents`
  gated on a resolvable team, so a duel player whose userinfo *and*
  KTX demoinfo team are both empty lost every entry: gameId 224758
  (iddQd, 34 deaths missing from the frags/deaths drill-down) and the
  bravado golden (speedball, 7 deaths). FragEvents were partially
  papered over by the duel post-processor's frogbot synthesis (rebuilt
  from obituaries); DeathEvents had no such fallback. Both exports now
  gate on a resolvable *name* — matching `killEvents`' documented
  rationale — with `team` best-effort (`""` when unresolvable,
  rewritten to the player's own name by duel normalization in 1v1s).
  Audited the remaining team-keyed consumers for the same class of
  loss: weapon pickups / items / messages fallback-fill instead of
  dropping, and aim, airgibs, loc graph, and region control are
  (re)computed after duel normalization, so they were already correct.

- **Frag streaks now include the opening life.** A player already alive
  when the match begins has no spawn recorded for that first life (the
  parser's initial SpawnEvent fires during warmup and is dropped as
  pre-match), so the spawn-to-death run from match start to first death
  never entered `timelineAnalysis.fragStreaks` — a player who never
  died had no streak at all (gameId 224758: reload's 33-frag run was
  missing). The streak detector now synthesizes a match-start spawn
  when a death or credited frag predates a player's first recorded
  spawn — strictly after match start, since KTX's match-start reset can
  surface as a death at exactly `StartTime` (gameId 212260) and must
  not shift the spawn/death pairing. Opening runs read `time: 0`
  (match-relative).

- **Weapon-stay pickup recovery (schema v46).** In weapon-stay modes
  (serverinfo `deathmatch` 2/3/5 or `coop` — dmm3, the standard
  duel/2on2 mode, included) KTX never emits `//ktx took` for weapons
  and the weapon entity never leaves the wire, so `result.weaponPickups`
  contained **zero world weapon pickups** on those demos and weapon
  `items` timelines never closed a phase. Both analyzers now synthesize
  the pickups from STAT_ITEMS weapon-bit 0→1 transitions: weapon_pickups
  records kind-level entries (`inferred: true`; `source: "world"` when
  the picker was in touch range of a matching pad during the stat-lag
  window, else the new `"unknown"` — typically a non-RL/LG backpack
  grant), and items.go closes the matched entity's phase as a
  zero-length unavailability (`takenAt == respawnAt`; the weapon never
  left the map). Spawn-loadout bursts and `//ktx bp` grants are
  deduplicated. Verified against KTX's own per-player counters
  (`TookWeaponHandler` increments before the weapon-stay early return,
  so `demoInfo.players[].weapons[].pickups.*` were always correct).

- **Pickups tab: KTX counters are the displayed numbers.** The
  weapon/item verify cells now show the KTX-authoritative counter as
  the cell value and acknowledge the analytics-derived count in the
  tooltip, instead of showing the analytics count and flagging
  divergence red. Rationale: in weapon-stay demos the analytics
  reconstruction is known-imperfect (wire-invisible grab-then-die
  coalescing, pad-vs-pack ambiguity), so a small divergence is
  expected, not an error — while the analytics stream stays the right
  source for timestamped/per-entity questions (the per-entity `@ loc`
  columns are unchanged). Demos without KTX pickup counters (old /
  non-KTX servers) fall back to the analytics counts, trusted as-is.

- **Duel team normalization now covers pickup/shot data (v46).** In 1v1
  demos `normalizeDuelTeams` rewrites every player's team to their own
  name, but `items` phase teams, `weaponPickups` team/dropperTeam,
  `backpacks` team, `shots` stream/byPlayer teams (feeding `aim` teams),
  and `airgibs` attacker/victim teams kept the raw pre-normalization
  strings — so the Pickups tab's per-team aggregation bucketed duel
  pickups under stale colour labels and showed zero rows. All are now
  rewritten in the duel pass (airgibs sources teams from the normalized
  player streams). The pass also reclassifies `shots[].victimKinds`
  `"team"` → `"enemy"` and folds the per-weapon `teamHits` bucket into
  `enemyHits` (v45's `victimKindOf` compares raw team strings, so a duel
  where both players share a colour team classified every opponent hit
  as team damage; in a 1v1 any non-self victim is an enemy — exact, since
  the single opponent pair classifies uniformly). Aim's enemy/team splits
  inherit the correction via `aimPost` ordering. The web Pickups tab's
  per-team tables also join the existing duel-mode hide
  (`team-aggregate-table`), matching the other per-team stats tables.

- **Pickup attribution: touch-instant sampling + measured 128 u gate
  (v46).** The Layer-4 distance corroborator now samples each player's
  position from the per-frame history at the entity-removal instant
  (which is the touch frame) instead of a latest-only sample up to
  250 ms stale, and all proximity consumers (corroborator, insta-regrab
  picker, weapon-stay classifiers) share one 128 u touch gate — genuine
  touches measure 54-104 u across the corpus, non-touch same-room grabs
  ≥150 u. A handful of beyond-gate guesses become honestly unattributed.

- **Shots/aim: enemy / team / self victim classification + Aim Stats
  Victims cycle** (schema v45). Every linked victim is now classified
  relative to the shooter — `enemy`, `team` (same non-empty team, not
  self) or `self` (own wire slot: rl/gl self-splash, i.e. rocket jumps) —
  mirroring the damage layer's `isSelf`/`isTeam` semantics, per victim
  per fire (one rocket can splash an enemy, a teammate and the shooter at
  once and counts in every bucket it has a victim in). `Shot` gains
  `victimKinds`, `WeaponShots` gains `enemyHits`/`teamHits`/`selfHits`,
  the aim crosshair/ramp samples gain a `team` column, and `WeaponAim`
  gains `enemy`/`team`/`self` counter slices (`WeaponAimSplit`: hits,
  pellet splits, direct — see RESULT_SCHEMA.md for the emission rules).
  All additive; `hits`/`accuracy` stay all-victims for KTX scoreboard
  parity. The Aim Stats tab gains a **Victims** filter
  (All / Enemy / Team / Self) that slices the weapon tables, the
  crosshair heatmaps + marginals and the LG ramp; **All** (default)
  preserves the previous numbers, and **Enemy** is the first view where
  rocket jumps no longer inflate RL hit % (they were always counted as
  hits — now visible under Self). Duels hide the Team option (no
  teammates); Self shows tables only (hitscan cannot self-hit, so there
  are no self crosshair samples). The MCP `getAim` tool and `/aim` +
  `/shots` endpoints carry the new fields automatically. Tab layout
  reworked alongside: the Victims strip sits at the top of the tab, the
  LG and SG crosshair blocks sit side by side where the pane is wide
  enough (stacking on narrow panes), and the player picker moved into
  the Crosshair placement panel — the only place it applies.

- **Aim: hits attribute to the confirmed victim** (schema v44). The v43
  liveness gate excluded the victim of a killing blow from attribution —
  the kill lands in the same frame the victim dies, so `losAliveAt` read
  the victim as already dead at the fire time. In team games the sample
  went to the nearest *other* live enemy, producing impossible
  "hits" tens of hull-widths off target (the big far-edge bars with
  nonzero hit counts in the Aim Stats marginal histograms — verified on
  hub demo 223930: 78 of 79 LG edge-bin hits were killing blows, the 79th
  a team-damage hit, while the beams ended inside the actual victim's
  hull); duels dropped their killing-blow samples entirely. Crosshair
  samples of hit shots now attribute to the server-confirmed victim
  (nearest by crosshair error when a pellet fire hit several), with no
  liveness gate and no enemy filter (team damage is a confirmed target —
  `tgt` can then name a teammate); misses keep the live-enemy
  nearest-crosshair heuristic. Duels gain one crosshair sample per
  hitscan kill; the web attribution note now spells out the hit/miss
  split.

- **API: `/shots` endpoint + complete `/aim`; MCP: `getAim`** (no schema
  change). New `GET /v1/demos/{id}/shots` serves the per-fire weapon stream
  (`result.Shots`: linked hits/victims, per-player aggregates, KTX
  reconciliation; `nails=1` opts into ng/sng fires). `/aim` and `/shots` are
  served from the stream-enriched parse (`EnsureShotStreams` re-parses on
  first request, then caches — the rebuilt `Shots`/`Aim` blocks are grafted
  onto the cached result), so the stream-derived aim blocks (RL/GL
  direct/splash, the LG near/blocked/out-of-range split) are now always
  present over the API instead of silently absent. New
  `GET /v1/demos/{id}/airgibs` serves the Key Moments airgib list
  (`timelineAnalysis.airgibs` — the last Result block with no endpoint);
  empty, not an error, on maps without a provisioned BSP. The MCP server
  adds a `getAim` tool (aim stats only — the raw per-fire stream stays
  API/JSON-only by design).

- **Wider BSP corpus + phantom map-alias fix.** `scripts/fetch-bsps.sh`
  now provisions the most-played 1on1/2on2 community maps from a
  hub.quakeworld.nu sample (ztndm3, metron, toxicity, dad2, catalyst,
  nova, pocket, katt, shifter, spinev2, zeal), so loc attribution,
  map geometry and the BSP-gated visibility metrics light up on them.
  Removed the `phantombase → phantoma` map alias in
  `mvd-analytics/loc/loader.go`: the phantom family (`phantom` /
  `phantoma` / `phantombase`) are distinct map versions and now each
  resolve to their own loc/entity/geometry data. Previously the alias
  routed the ~1000-game `phantombase` corpus through the 23-game
  `phantoma` data; this touched every `NormalizeMapName` consumer — loc,
  mapents, mapbsp, and the `/v1/maps/{map}` endpoint. Only the dominant
  `phantombase` BSP is fetched; the low-play predecessors are not.

## 2026-07-03

- **Aim: alive-gated attribution + density image, marginal histograms,
  share-of-fires columns** (schema v43).
  Crosshair-error target attribution now skips enemies who are dead at the
  fire time (same liveness rule as line of sight, `losAliveAt` over the
  spawn/death streams). Dead players keep streaming position samples — the
  death-anim body — so a corpse sitting near the crosshair could previously
  win nearest-crosshair attribution in team games and log a guaranteed-miss
  sample; a duel fire while the lone enemy is dead now emits no sample at
  all (the per-weapon fire counts still include it). No field changes —
  sample counts and targets shift on team demos. The web Aim Stats tab
  replaces the crosshair grid with a **smoothed density image** per weapon
  (LG and SG): a Gaussian-smoothed 2-D histogram on canvas (the shared
  viridis ramp anchored to the page background at zero, like the table
  heatmaps; no external deps) with hull box + dead-center overlays, axis
  ticks and a colorbar in shots per bin; hover reads exact shot/hit counts.
  Under each image, two **marginal histograms**: the same normalized
  samples projected onto one axis at a time — yaw (enemy left ↔ right) and
  pitch (enemy below ↔ above) — zero-centered bins, with the |n| ≤ 1
  on-hull band shaded and a dead-center rule. Image and histograms share
  the same extents (yaw ±6, pitch ±4); samples outside them are dropped
  from the image (a clamp pile-up would paint a bright rim) but stay
  visible in the histograms' clamp edge bins. The LG ramp panel is folded
  into the LG block as a third histogram in the same style (hit % by time
  since the shaft opened, hover for per-bin counts; `lgRamp` in the
  schema is unchanged), and the histograms stack vertically. All binning
  stays client-side. The per-weapon accuracy
  tables add **share-of-fires % columns** next to every count (LG
  near/blocked/far, RL/GL direct/splash/missed, SG/SSG full/partial/miss)
  so players with different shot volumes compare directly.

## 2026-06-28

- **Aim analytics** (schema v41–v42). A new top-level `aim` block: per-player aim
  metrics derived as a post-processor from `shots` + `streams`
  (position/view interpolated at fire time) + `damage` + LG `beams`. Columnar
  per-shot **crosshair-error samples** for hitscan (sg/ssg/lg) — both signed
  degrees off the enemy and a version normalized by the target's angular size
  (range-comparable; radius 1 ≈ the hitbox edge); an **LG ramp-onto-target**
  series (ms since shaft start + hit); **rocket direct/splash** counts; and an
  **LG reach/whiff** classification (near miss vs blocked vs unresolved).
  Target attribution is exact in duels (`mode: "duel"`) and a labeled
  nearest-crosshair-enemy heuristic in team games (`mode: "team"`). Computed
  by default for every client (CLI / API / web) — the crosshair + ramp blocks
  always; the rocket + reach blocks when the projectile/beam streams were
  built (the WASM map build, `qw-analyze -include projectiles,beams`). The web
  UI adds an experimental **Aim Stats** tab that renders the block: a rich
  per-weapon table (SG/SSG pellets hit/fired + full/partial/whiff fires, RL/GL
  direct/splash/missed, LG near-aim/blocked whiffs — the pellet and direct
  figures match the server's authoritative stats), a hitscan
  crosshair-placement heatmap (shot density, normalized so ±1 = the hull edge),
  and an LG ramp chart. Also adds a reusable
  `result.PositionTrack.SampleAt` interpolating
  sampler (position + shortest-arc view angle + velocity) other position-
  derived analytics can adopt. The web table is one table per weapon with
  players on the rows (team-coloured like the Summary tab), and the heatmap is
  split into LG and SG. Shots gained `warmup` (v42) — fires outside the match;
  the aim analysis is match-time and excludes them, matching `shots.byPlayer`.

## 2026-06-27

- **Weapon-fire map overlay** (schema v40). Two opt-in spatial streams under
  `streams` for the 3D map view: `projectiles` (every tracked rocket/grenade
  flight as a spawn→despawn segment + times) and `beams` (every LG
  `TE_LIGHTNING2` bolt as a muzzle→impact segment + time), both columnar.
  They are **off by default** — sizeable in a team game (thousands of beams)
  — and built only on request: `qw-analyze -include projectiles,beams`, and
  the WASM map build (where the result stays in browser memory, so no extra
  download). The map renders rockets/grenades as moving dots and LG bolts as
  brief beams at the playback cursor (`drawProjectiles` / `drawBeams`). The
  REST API serves them as three independent, build-on-demand endpoints —
  `GET /v1/demos/{id}/streams/{projectiles|beams|nails}` — re-parsing the
  cached demo on the first request and latching the result (like `/los`).

- **Nail (ng/sng) tracking** (schema v40, opt-in). A separate, highest-volume
  request (`qw-analyze -include nails`) that decodes nails — spike packet
  entities on `sv_nailhack` servers (the common case), or the `svc_nails` /
  `svc_nails2` stream otherwise — brackets each nail's flight, links ng/sng
  fires to their nail damage (`hit`/`victims`, approximate: per-fire linking
  credits one of SNG's two nails), and emits a `streams.nails` map overlay.
  Off everywhere by default — including the web map — so nails are never
  downloaded unless explicitly requested. Per-player nail hit counts track
  KTX's within a small margin across the corpus.

- **Per-shot weapon-fire stream** (schema v39). New top-level `shots`
  result: who fired what weapon, at exactly what match-relative ms — the
  foundation for accuracy metrics (including over short intervals) and for
  external analysis correlating crosshair/aim movement with when shots were
  taken (join a shot's `time` against `streams.players[].pos` view
  angles/velocity).
  - **Detection.** SG/SSG/RL/GL/NG/SNG fires come from `svc_sound` on the
    shooter's `CHAN_WEAPON` — the sound carries the firing entity, so
    attribution is exact and works on **any** QW server (not just KTX), and
    the distinct fire wavs disambiguate RL vs GL where ammo deltas cannot.
    (The Quake sound filenames are historically mismatched: the rocket
    launcher fires `sgun1.wav`, the nailgun fires `rocket1i.wav`.) LG has no
    per-shot fire sound, so it is counted from its `TE_LIGHTNING2` beam —
    emitted once per fire tick and carrying the firing entity directly
    (`source:"beam"`). One beam == one LG attack == one cell, so LG counts
    match KTX `acc.attacks` exactly. The beam decode also surfaces the
    muzzle→impact geometry as `BeamEvent` (for map rendering).
  - **Truthful cross-linking.** Instantaneous hitscan fires (sg/ssg/lg) are
    linked to the damage they caused in the **same server frame** via the
    KTX `mvdhidden_dmgdone` stream (`hit`/`victims`). Rocket/grenade fires
    (rl/gl) are linked by **entity flight tracking**: the projectile entity
    brackets the flight (`spawn → despawn`), so a fire is matched to its
    launch frame (by muzzle) and its impact damage to the shooter's
    same-weapon damage at the despawn frame — which disambiguates *which*
    fire caused *which* impact when several rockets are in flight (a naive
    "next damage" link cannot). Across the corpus, rl/gl connect-counts
    match KTX's authoritative `real` hit counts to within one. Nail fires
    (ng/sng) ride a separate stream and stay unlinked for now.
  - New parser events `ProjectileSpawnEvent` / `ProjectileDespawnEvent`
    track rocket (`progs/missile.mdl`) and grenade (`progs/grenade.mdl`)
    entities by their recycled entity number.
  - **Validation built in.** A `reconciliation` block cross-checks detected
    counts against KTX's authoritative `acc.attacks`; across the golden
    corpus the converted `streamAttacks` matches KTX exactly (a 4on4 game
    reconciles 42/42 player×weapon rows), with LG occasionally off by a
    single cell at a death/discharge boundary.
  - New parser events: `svc_sound` is decoded into `SoundEvent` and
    `svc_soundlist` is captured to resolve fired sounds to weapons.

- **Line-of-sight & potential-visibility metrics** (schema v37–v38,
  [#94](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/94)). Two new
  per-opponent visibility tracks on `PlayerStream`, both computed lazily
  on first request (the heaviest position-derived pass, BSP-gated — only
  on maps with a provisioned BSP; absent from the default parse):
  - **`PlayerStream.LOS`** (v37) — geometric **line of sight**: intervals
    during which a player has a clear ray to an opponent (eye point at
    `origin + (0,0,22)`, nine rays against the BSP clip hull and moving
    movers, the opponent's bounding-box corners + centre). Directional, so
    asymmetric one-way sightlines are preserved; gated to live players
    (alive from match start, not the first recorded spawn).
  - **`PlayerStream.PVS`** (v38) — server-reproduced **potential
    visibility**: whether a live mvdsv would have sent that opponent's
    entity to this player's client at that frame, made wire-exact against
    `SV_PlayerVisibleToClient` (fat PVS of `origin + view_ofs` vs. the
    target's entity-leaf set, with the `MAX_ENT_LEAFS` overflow gate).
    PVS ⊇ LOS by construction; the **PVS-minus-LOS gap** is an
    occlusion-tolerant proximity/awareness signal, not a sightline.

  Surfaced three ways: the REST/MCP **`/v1/demos/{id}/los`** endpoint
  (returns both `los` and `pvs`), the CLI, and the **web map overlay** —
  two per-player toggles (**LOS**, **PVS**) that draw inter-player lines
  on the 3D map tab (PVS as thin faint lines beneath the thicker LOS
  lines), both filled by one lazy pass and cached client-side. Both
  metrics are `omitempty`/absent on non-BSP maps, so the schema bump is
  additive for existing consumers.

## 2026-06-20

- **API contract cleanup** (schema v36). Consolidates the REST/MCP
  surface; section-filtering logic moves into the shared
  `mvd-analytics/view` layer (REST, MCP, and WASM now share one tested
  implementation — no wire change from that move). The observable contract
  changes:

  **Breaking**
  - **`match.startTime` / `match.endTime` removed** from the result. They
    were always `0` / equal to `duration` and duplicated
    `streams.global.matchStart` / `matchEnd`. Read **`match.duration`** for
    match length and **`streams.global`** for the match window. (The
    `endTime` key disappears from the `match` object; `startTime` was
    already `omitempty`-absent.) Schema bumps **35 → 36**, so the ETag /
    `X-Schema-Version` change and cached results re-validate.
  - **`GET /v1/demos/{id}/map-entities` removed** (and the MCP
    `getMapEntities` tool). Use **`GET /v1/maps/{map}/entities`** (MCP
    `getMapEntitiesByMap`) — identical payload; get the map name from
    `/overview`.
  - **`view_error` (400) is gone** — every malformed/rejected query now
    returns **`invalid_param` (400)**, including an unknown `fields` code or
    reducer name.

  **Additive / non-breaking**
  - **`/region-control` accepts `from` / `to`** (match-relative seconds) to
    clip control attribution to a sub-window.
  - **`weapon` is a comma-separated set on every endpoint** that takes it
    (`/frags`, `/damage`, `/backpacks`, `/weapon-pickups`); `/backpacks`
    previously accepted only a single value.
  - **Query-parameter names are case-insensitive** (canonical spelling
    stays camelCase: `windowMs`, `minDwellMs`, `includeTeam`).
  - **Documented "section absent" rule**: capability-gated sections
    (`demoinfo`, `damage`, `frags`, `loc-graph`, `metadata`,
    `region-control`) return `422 <section>_unavailable`;
    always-computable / list sections (`items`, `backpacks`,
    `weapon-pickups`, `chat`) return `200` with an empty body.

- **3D map view & mover streams** (schema v34–v35,
  [#91](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/91)). `streams.movers[]`
  carries the pose timeline of every tracked brush-model entity (lift, door,
  plat, train); map geometry gains version 4 (per-vertex 3D triangles +
  optional `walls` / `liquids` / `submodels`), and
  `timelineAnalysis.locationData` collapses to one medoid anchor point per
  loc name (v34) so map labels no longer duplicate. Drives the new
  orbit-camera 3D map tab over a usage-pruned committed corpus.

## 2026-06-14

- **Float32 positions, velocity & height** (schema v33,
  [#90](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/90)). `pos.x/y/z`,
  `pos.vx/vy/vz` and `pos.h` change from `int32` to `float32`, so the
  wire-native sub-unit origin is no longer truncated to whole units and the
  derived velocity loses its ±1-unit quantization noise. Values stay native
  float32 in memory; JSON text is rounded to 3 decimals (lossless for
  eighth-unit coords). The `hgt` no-floor sentinel changes to `-1000000000`.

## 2026-06-13

- **Player view direction & velocity** (schema v31–v32). Every
  native-rate position sample now also carries **where the player is
  looking** — view pitch/yaw kept losslessly as the raw `angle16` wire
  value (`pos.vp`/`vya`, decode `uint16(v)*360/65536`) — and a derived
  per-sample **velocity** vector in units/sec (`pos.vx`/`vy`/`vz`) from a
  central-difference estimator that does not differentiate across
  respawns, map teleporters, or time gaps. The view-layer query API and
  CLI gain opt-in per-channel field codes: `pos` is now strictly x/y/z,
  with `view`, `hgt`, `lq`, and `vel` each requestable on their own
  (served by mvd-api `stream-slice` / `state-at` / `buckets`).

## 2026-06-12

- **Per-sample floor height, airgibs, movers, liquids** (schema v24–v30,
  [#84](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/84)). Every
  position sample now carries the player's height above the floor
  (BSP clip-hull traces, footprint-aware, standing on lifts/doors at
  their demo-streamed poses) and a water/slime/lava submersion state.
  On top of it: the **airgibs** Key Moment — direct enemy rocket hits on
  airborne victims, with lethality, Hub shooter links, and the victim's
  height above the shooter as the headline "how spectacular" number.

## 2026-06-07

- **Wall-clock timing for demos** (schema v23,
  [#82](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/82)). Recovers a
  real-world clock anchor for each demo so any match-relative time maps
  to wall-clock time; pause segments are accounted for in the mapping.
- **Demo-start timestamp decoding**
  ([#83](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/83)). Parses the
  mvdhidden `0x000B` block (ULEB128 Unix-ms) — the millisecond-accurate
  demo-open anchor the wall-clock mapping builds on.

## 2026-06-03

- **Per-hit damage end to end** (schema v20,
  [#81](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/81)). The KTX
  hidden damage stream becomes a full per-hit log with
  attacker→victim matrices, per-weapon aggregates, and EWep
  victim-weapon buckets; telefrags and stomps are surfaced separately.
- **Corrected scoreboard stats** (schema v19,
  [#80](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/80)). Kills,
  deaths and suicides corrected from the frag log for every consumer;
  efficiency is kills-based to match hub.quakeworld.nu.

## 2026-06-02

- **Player timelines**
  ([#79](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/79)). Per-player
  timeline view of vitals, weapons and powerups across the match.

## 2026-05-30

- **Static map-entity corpus + map endpoints** (schema v14,
  [#77](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/77)). Item and
  spawn locations extracted from map BSPs ship embedded, with REST
  endpoints to serve per-map geometry and entities.

## 2026-05-29

- **Schema reference reconciled with code**
  ([#76](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/76)).
  RESULT_SCHEMA.md brought back in lock-step with `result/` after
  drift; version history table became the single change record.

## 2026-05-25

- **Reconnect identity unified** (
  [#75](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/75)). A player
  rejoining mid-match keeps one identity across slots; deaths and
  pickups reconcile against KTX's authoritative counters.

## 2026-05-24

- **Locs & Regions tab**
  ([#74](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/74)).
  Combat-posture loc graphs (armed/unarmed movement between locs) plus
  sortable loc heatmap and region tables in the web UI.

## 2026-05-23

- **Column-major bucket format** (schema v11,
  [#72](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/72)). Bucketed
  timelines ship as columnar arrays; the legacy HighResBucket shape is
  dropped.
- **Web load perf tuning**
  ([#70](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/70)). Profiling,
  deferred bucket builds, and a faster `view.Buckets` cut initial load
  time.
- **Chat dedup on KTX demos**
  ([#68](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/68)). Per-recipient
  copies of the same chat line collapse to one message.

## 2026-05-20

- **Visibility-aware loc attribution** (schema v9–v10,
  [#64](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/64)). Loc
  resolution gains a BSP PVS veto (locvis V6) so positions no longer
  bleed through walls to the nearest loc point; death/spawn handling
  rebuilt on top.
- **API/MCP loc representation**
  ([#65](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/65)). Views
  return loc names by default with an opt-in index mode; analyzer
  errors surface properly through the API.
- **MCP fixes**
  ([#67](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/67)). Array tool
  outputs wrapped for spec compliance; `getItems` filter vocabulary
  corrected.

## 2026-05-16

- **All times become int32 milliseconds** (schema v8,
  [#62](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/62)). Every
  timestamped field migrates from float seconds to the MVD wire
  format's native integer-ms unit, eliminating float drift at
  boundaries.
- **Region control as a normal view**
  ([#63](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/63)). Region
  control re-derives from streams like every other view instead of
  being a parse-time special case.

## 2026-05-15

- **REST API + MCP server** (
  [#61](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/61)). `mvd-api`
  serves analysis over HTTP with a demo cache, and an MCP server
  exposes the same views to AI tooling; repository reorganised into the
  three-module workspace.

## 2026-05-11

- **Streams as canonical storage** (schema v7,
  [#60](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/60)). Per-player
  change streams, intervals, and the native-rate position track replace
  parse-time buckets as the single event-rate source all views derive
  from.

## 2026-05-09

- **Timeline GL/ammo, clean chat text, Go region control** (schema v6,
  [#59](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/59)). Timeline
  gains grenade launcher and ammo tracking, chat messages get a
  markup-stripped `messageClean`, and region control moves from the
  frontend into the Go analyzer.

## 2026-05-08

- **Match in the header**
  ([#57](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/57)). The web UI
  shows the loaded match in the header bar and tab title.
- **Timeline rendering rewrite**
  ([#56](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/56)). Scanline
  rendering fixes resize artifacts and speeds the timeline up.

## 2026-05-07

- **Per-map regions from JSON** (
  [#55](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/55)). Embedded
  per-map region definitions fully replace the auto-detection
  heuristic.

## 2026-05-03

- **Pickups tab**
  ([#54](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/54)). Per-player
  item pickup breakdown in the web UI, with the KTX weapon-pickup
  counter semantics documented.

## 2026-05-02

- **Search tab**
  ([#53](https://github.com/galfthan/mvd_analyzer/pull/53)). Search for
  demos from the web UI, with a reshaped tab layout around it.
