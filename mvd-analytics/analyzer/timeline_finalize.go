//
//   - It must not MERGE. A death and the respawn it triggers can land on the

//     [..,T) and [T,..). clipIntervals ends in mergeIntervals, which unions on
//     `Start <= End` — i.e. touching counts as overlapping — and welds them
//     back into one, erasing the death. For a liveness predicate that is
//     harmless (a zero-width dead gap changes no duration), but Alive is
//     documented and consumed as the player's LIVES, so anything counting
//     lives or attributing per-life stats would silently lose one.
//   - It must not SPLIT on interior gaps. A hole in the track means the player
//     was not observed, not that they died — on a POV recording only players
//     inside the recorder's PVS are written, so tracks are full of holes and
//     splitting there would invent lives nobody lived. The occupancy walkers
//     handle unobserved time themselves, via result.SampleStaleCapMs; that is
//     the right layer for it, because "don't credit presence you didn't see"
//     and "how many lives were there" are different questions.

// presenceBounds is the span [lo, hi) the player is known to exist in, which

//
// The position track is the dense evidence, but it is not the ONLY evidence:
// spawns and deaths are broadcast to every recorder (an obituary is global),
// so a player whose track stops — on a POV recording everyone outside the
// recorder's PVS drops out of svc_playerinfo — is still known to exist at
// every later marker. Reading the track alone put a death outside every life,
// which is the one thing a life list must never do (the lives view then labels
// the truncated life "leftGame" and drops the rest), and it contradicted
// lastObservedMs, which counts the same markers as existence evidence: a
// player with no track kept their marker-derived lives while a player with a
// truncated one lost them.
//
// The two ends are deliberately not symmetric, because the evidence is not,
// and the HIGH end depends on which kind of marker trails the track.
//
//   - A DEATH at or past the track's end both proves existence and ENDS the
//     life it closes, so hi extends exactly to it: nothing after a death is
//     claimed, and the death still lands inside a life.
//   - A SPAWN as the last marker at or past the track's end proves the player
//     re-entered, and nothing afterwards contradicts it, so hi extends to the
//     end of the alive window — the life that spawn starts keeps its
//     marker-derived end. Clipping hi AT the spawn instead (the original rule:
//     "a marker after the track proves existence at that instant and nothing
//     past it") deleted that life outright, because the life is [spawn, …) and
//     clipping it to [spawn, spawn) makes it zero-width; clipToPresence then
//     drops it. Downstream, its frags and deaths get attributed to the
//     PREVIOUS life, which the same response says ended at the death before
//     the spawn — kills made while provably alive attached to a life the
//     response denies existed.
//
// Extending to the window end is the consistent degradation, not a special
// case: a player with NO track at all keeps their full marker-derived lives,
// the last of them running to the window end, because there is no presence
// evidence to clip against. A track that stops before a trailing spawn is the
// same evidential situation past that spawn, so it degrades the same way. It
// is also what the repo's surface-authoritative-data doctrine (CLAUDE.md)
// asks for: the wider claim is visible and interpretable, whereas deleting a
// marker-proven life silently destroys data no consumer can recover.
//
// At the LOW end a DEATH before the track proves the player was in the game —
// and, by the canonical liveness rule, alive — for the run-up to it, so the
// low clip has nothing left to stand on and is dropped. A SPAWN before the
// track start is the join itself and proves no such thing; extending on it
// would re-introduce the "alive before they connected" claim the low clip
// exists to remove.
