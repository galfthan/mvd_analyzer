// Roster is the canonical player/team table with the duel (player-name-as-team)
// rewrite folded in. It is produced once by RosterAnalyzer (a CoreProducer)
// from co.DemoInfo and published on CoreOutputs, so every producer labels teams
// correctly AT BIRTH instead of a whole-Result rewrite fixing them afterwards.
//
// Publishing it replaces the old normalizeDuelTeams post-processor: instead of
// stamping the raw userinfo team on every record and then re-pointing them all
// at the synthetic name-per-player teams, each producer calls TeamFor as it
// emits — "born correct". The label decision is a local, testable call rather
// than an entry in one giant enumerating function.
//
// Nil-safe like Clock: a nil Roster (hand-built registries / unit tests that
// don't wire it) is a non-duel passthrough — TeamFor returns the raw team and
// Duel reports false, so the raw signal flows through untouched.

	// isDuel is true for a 1v1: the team concept is meaningless (each player
	// picks an arbitrary colour tag, or a frogbot has no team at all), so team
	// labels are rewritten to the player's own name.

	// individual is the general form of the same rewrite: the resolved game
	// mode has no teams at all (GameMode.TeamBased false, from a source that
	// actually saw a mode or a teamplay cvar — see individualLayoutFromMode),
	// so every player is their own side. FFA is the case it exists for: KTX
	// forces `teamplay 0` there (ktx/src/world.c:1652-1655) and the userinfo
	// team tags players still wear are clan decoration — on ffa_1[dm2] three
	// of them read `red` and those three killed each other.
	//
	// It differs from isDuel only in the participant set: a duel rewrites
	// exactly the two demoinfo players and leaves anyone else's tag alone,
	// while an individual mode has no fixed roster (players come and go, and
	// a matchless FFA carries no demoinfo block to enumerate them), so every
	// name it is asked about is its own side.
