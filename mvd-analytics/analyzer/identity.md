# identity analyser

**Phase:** Core (registered right after `demoinfo`)
**Inputs:** `UserInfoEvent`, `PrintEvent`
**Writes to Result:** nothing
**Writes to CoreOutputs:** `co.Sessions` + the `co.SlotIdentityAt(slot, tMs)` resolver it backs

## What it does

Reconstructs player identity across reconnects so per-player outputs
aren't mislabelled. A player who disconnects and reconnects mid-match
gets a *new* wire slot (and a new userid); the slot they vacated is often
reused by someone else or stamped with a late userinfo name. The old
slot→final-name resolution (`co.Slots`) then relabels the player's
pre-reconnect events with the wrong name. KTX itself unifies the player
via its ghost mechanism (restore-stats-by-netname on reconnect,
`ktx/src/client.c:1513-1538`); this analyser reproduces that unification.

## How it works

1. **Sessions (during the event pass).** Each `UserInfoEvent` opens /
   continues / rotates a per-slot *session* (one contiguous occupancy by
   a single userid). A new session opens when a slot's userid changes; a
   plain name change with the same userid stays one session (a rename,
   which final-name resolution already handled correctly). Scalars are
   copied off `e.Player` — the parser mutates that struct in place on the
   next occupancy (`mvd-reader/parser/userinfo.go:47-54`).
2. **Reconnect prints.** `rejoins the game with …` / `reenters the game
   without stats` broadcasts are recorded (already Q-normalised to
   ASCII, so the `[team]` brackets and redtext fold to plain text).
3. **Unification (`PopulateCore`).** Sessions are folded into canonical
   identities via union-find over four signals, in priority order:
   (1) shared nonzero `*auth` login; (2) same demoinfo player (login or
   normalized-name join, reusing the `demoinfo` index); (3) a KTX
   `rejoins`/`reenters` print for that netname; (4) bare-demo fallback —
   unify by normalized netname, *only* when there is no demoinfo, no auth
   and no reconnect print (so modern demos never over-merge two distinct
   same-name players).
4. **Output.** `co.Sessions[slot]` is the time-sorted, identity-resolved
   occupancy list (first session extends to -inf, last to +inf so edge
   events still resolve). `co.SlotIdentityAt(slot, tMs)` returns the
   identity that held the slot at `tMs`.

## Who consumes it

- **items**, **weapon_pickups**, **timeline** (frag events, powerups,
  streaks) resolve each event by its own timestamp via
  `co.SlotIdentityAt`, so pre-reconnect events stay with the right player.
- **timeline streams** group per-slot builders by
  `ResolvedSession.IdentityKey`, stitching a player's two slots into one
  `PlayerStream` (and carving a slot shared by two players at the
  handover). Phantom sessions with no recorded play are dropped.

## Limitations / known issues

- A reconnect with **no demoinfo, no auth, no KTX print** and a
  **different netname** each time cannot be unified — there is no signal
  linking the two names. (The bare-demo fallback only joins identical
  normalized names.)
- The bare-demo name fallback could merge two genuinely distinct players
  who share a name on an old non-KTX demo; this matches the pre-existing
  risk of the name-join in `Context.ResolveSlotDemoInfo`.
