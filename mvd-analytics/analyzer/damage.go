// bounded value differs only by the overkill on a KILLING hit, which the wire
// hides but the end-of-frame death broadcast reveals exactly:
//
//   - A survived hit has no overkill: bounded == raw, identically. No health
//     knowledge needed — only liveliness (no death this frame).
//   - A killing hit: bounded = raw + deathValue. Since raw = save+take and
//     bounded = save+min(take,health_pre) = save+health_pre while
//     deathValue = health_pre-take, the armor share cancels — the identity is
//     exact (modulo the -1 coercion when health lands exactly on 0, at most a
//     1-low residual on that hit).
//   - Same-frame multi-hit death: one deathValue covers the frame's hits.
//     Wire order is application order, so the overkill |deathValue| is
//     deducted from each hit's health share from LAST to FIRST, flooring each
//     hit's bounded at its save share (the one case where the save split —
//     re-derived from the wire int, approximate — enters a normal hit; it is
//     exact everywhere else because it cancels).
//
// Two wire limitations force an approximate shadow-cap fallback (see
// shadowFallback): KTX clamps a corpse's health at -99 (combat.c:257-260), so
// a death value AT that floor hides a deeper overkill; and a tight
// death→respawn broadcasts the respawn's positive health, masking the death
// value entirely (detected via the authoritative DeathEvent).
//
// The nullification paths are unchanged and do NOT read the death signal (a
// nullified hit deals no health damage, so it can't kill): a pent or tp1/tp3
// hit is bounded to its armor share (save), a tp4 team hit to 0, all skipped
