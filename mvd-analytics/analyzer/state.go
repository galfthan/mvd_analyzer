package analyzer

// Shared sub-structs used by the timeline analyzer to group related fields
// instead of leaving them as a flat sprawl of `hasRL` / `hasLG` / `hasQuad` /
// `health` / `shells` / `x` / ... fields on every state struct.
//
// Grouping pulls a few small wins out of the analyzer:
//
//   - per-bucket and per-window aggregator structs can copy a whole substruct
//     in one assignment (`agg.ammo = pRaw.ammo`) instead of stamping each
//     field by hand;
//   - the boolean weapon/powerup flags get an OR-fold helper so the
//     `aggregateWindow` loop reads as one line per group instead of five;
//   - powerupKinds (used by detectPowerupEvents) can iterate the powerup
//     loadout as data instead of going through closures over each named
//     field.

// weaponLoadout records which weapons a player is carrying at a sample point.
// SG (baseline) and NG are intentionally not tracked.
type weaponLoadout struct {
	rl, lg, ssg, sng, gl bool

// powerupLoadout records the three QuakeWorld powerups.

// vitals holds the health/armor pair at a sample point. armorType is part
// of the same logical group because picking up RA replaces YA replaces GA.

// streamBuilder is the per-slot append-only record that becomes
// result.PlayerStream at finalize. It's the historical companion to
// timelinePlayerState (the running cursor): the cursor holds "what
// is the value right now," the builder holds "every transition we've
// seen." Both share OnEvent dispatch.
//
// Append rules (D11 in PLAN-v3):
//
//   - Change streams (health, armor, ammo, ...) dedup against the
//     previous value: appendChange iff v != lastValue.
//   - Position track appends every native sample (positions almost
//     always differ; checking is overhead with no payoff).
//   - Interval streams open an anchor on false→true and close on
//     true→false; intervals open at match end are closed in
//     finalize.
//   - Spawns / deaths are timestamps; just append.
