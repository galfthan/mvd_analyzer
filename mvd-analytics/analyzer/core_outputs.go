package analyzer

// CoreOutputs is the typed bundle of state-reconstruction results
// that derived analysers consume during their Finalize. It replaces
// the previous mechanism — shared mutable Context fields like
// ctx.DemoInfo and ctx.FragEntries written by one analyser's Finalize
// and read by the next, with no compile-time guarantee that the
// writer ran first.
//
// The registry builds this struct incrementally as core analysers
// finalize, then calls UseCoreOutputs on every analyser that
// implements CoreConsumer just before its own Finalize runs. Two-phase
// in spirit (core finishes its writes, derived starts its reads), but
// the registration order still drives the actual sequencing — there
// is no separate "phase 1 / phase 2" loop today.
//
// Adding a field here is the right place when an analyser's Finalize
// would otherwise need to peek into another analyser's intermediate
// state.
type CoreOutputs struct {
	// DemoInfo is the parsed KTX demoinfo JSON, populated from the
	// demoinfo analyser's Finalize. Nil when the demo has no demoinfo
	// hidden message (older demos, non-KTX servers).
	DemoInfo *DemoInfoResult

	// Names resolves a display-name string back to its demoinfo team.
	// Built once from DemoInfo so callers don't each rebuild their own
	// nameToTeam map. Nil-safe: TeamForName returns "" when the table
	// itself is nil.
	Names *NameTable

	// FragEntries is the canonical frag-event log emitted by the frag
	// analyser. Used by timeline (streaks, powerup-frag counts) and
	// weapon_pickups (kill attribution). Nil when the demo had no
	// obituaries or the frag analyser was not registered.
	FragEntries []FragEntry

	// Slots is the per-slot resolved player view: Name is the demoinfo
	// display name when the slot matches a demoinfo entry (via login or
	// name join), otherwise the userinfo name from ctx.Players[slot].
	// Team is the userinfo team (the demoinfo team override only kicks
	// in via NameTable lookups).
	//
	// Slots replaces the previous mid-Finalize patch in registry.go that
	// rewrote ctx.Players[slot].Name in place — the patch was the worst
	// instance of cross-analyser shared mutable state in the audit. Now
	// every Finalize site that wants the display name reads
	// co.Slots[slot].Name instead, and ctx.Players keeps its on-the-wire
	// userinfo values untouched.
	Slots map[int]SlotInfo
}

// SlotInfo holds the per-slot resolved player name and team that
// downstream Finalize sites read. See CoreOutputs.Slots for the
// resolution rules.
type SlotInfo struct {
	Name string
	Team string

// SlotName returns the resolved display name for slot. Equivalent to
// co.Slots[slot].Name with nil-safety on co; returns "" when the slot
// has no recorded entry.

// CoreConsumer is the optional interface for analysers that need
// access to CoreOutputs before their Finalize runs. The registry
// checks for this interface and invokes UseCoreOutputs in registration
// order, so an implementer is guaranteed to see every core output
// produced by an analyser registered earlier than itself.
type CoreConsumer interface {
	UseCoreOutputs(co *CoreOutputs)
}

// CoreProducer is the optional interface for analysers that contribute
// fields to CoreOutputs after their own Finalize runs. The registry
// invokes PopulateCore on every implementer immediately after the
// analyser's Finalize, so any analyser registered later in the slice
// (Core or Derived) sees the produced fields.
