// CoreOutputs is the typed bundle of state-reconstruction results
// that derived analysers consume during their Finalize. It replaces
// the previous mechanism — shared mutable Context fields like
// ctx.DemoInfo and ctx.FragEntries written by one analyser's Finalize
// and read by the next, with no compile-time guarantee that the
// writer ran first.
//
// The registry builds this struct incrementally: each CoreProducer
// publishes via PopulateCore right after its own Finalize, and every
// CoreConsumer receives the running struct just before its Finalize.
// A consumer may rely only on the fields whose producers its declared
// dag.go edges schedule first — the edges, not tiers or registration
// order, drive the sequencing.
//
// Adding a field here is the right place when an analyser's Finalize
// would otherwise need to peek into another analyser's intermediate
// state. Keep the field → producing-node table in
// WRITING_AN_ANALYZER.md §1 in sync when you do.
type CoreOutputs struct {
	// DemoInfo is the parsed KTX demoinfo JSON, populated from the
	// demoinfo analyser's Finalize. Nil when the demo has no demoinfo

	DemoInfo *DemoInfoResult

	// Names resolves a display-name string back to its demoinfo team.
	// Produced by the demoinfo node (PopulateCore) alongside DemoInfo, so
	// callers don't each rebuild their own nameToTeam map. Nil-safe:
	// TeamForName returns "" when the table itself is nil.
	Names *NameTable

	// FragEntries is the canonical frag-event log emitted by the frag
	// analyser. Used by timeline (streaks, powerup-frag counts) and
	// weapon_pickups (kill attribution). Nil when the demo had no
	// obituaries or the frag analyser was not registered.
	FragEntries []FragEntry

	// VictimNamedTeamkills are teamkill obituaries that name only the
	// victim ("X was telefragged by his teammate"). Produced by the frag
	// node alongside FragEntries. The killer is the
	// generic "teammate", so they never enter FragEntries; the
	// recoverTelefragTeamkills post-processor recovers the killer from
	// position co-location + the teamkiller's -1 frag-delta.

	// Slots is the per-slot resolved player view, produced by the
	// demoinfo node (PopulateCore): Name is the demoinfo
	// display name when the slot matches a demoinfo entry (via login or
	// name join), otherwise the userinfo name from ctx.Players[slot].
	// Team is the userinfo team (the demoinfo team override only kicks
	// in via NameTable lookups).
	//
	// Slots replaces the previous mid-Finalize patch in registry.go that
	// rewrote ctx.Players[slot].Name in place — the patch was the worst
	// instance of cross-analyser shared mutable state in the audit. Now
	// every Finalize site that wants the display name reads
	// co.Slots[slot].Name instead, and ctx.Players keeps its on-the-wire
	// userinfo values untouched.
	//
	// Slots maps one slot → one *final* occupant, which is wrong when a
	// player reconnects onto another slot and their old slot is reused
	// (or stamped with a late userinfo name). Finalize sites that have an
	// event timestamp should prefer SlotIdentityAt(slot, tMs) instead;
	// Slots remains for the few callers with no time to key on.

	// during it. Nil when the identity analyser was not registered.
	Sessions map[int][]ResolvedSession

	// Clock is the match-relative time base every producer converts to at
	// Finalize (see clock.go). Produced by ClockAnalyzer (a CoreProducer with
	// no dependencies). Nil when the clock analyser was not registered (hand-built
	// registries / unit tests) — MatchStartMs / ToMatch are nil-safe and
	// resolve to demo time in that case.
	Clock *Clock

	// Roster is the canonical player/team table with the duel (player-name-as-
	// team) rewrite folded in (see roster.go). Produced by RosterAnalyzer, whose
	// `requires` edge on "demoinfo" means it sees the fully-populated DemoInfo.
	// Every producer reads TeamFor to stamp final team labels at emission,
	// replacing the old whole-Result normalizeDuelTeams rewrite. Nil when the
	// roster analyser was
	// not registered — TeamFor / Duel are nil-safe and pass raw teams through.
	Roster *Roster

	// ServerInfoMap is the serverinfo `map` key MetadataAnalyzer parsed from the
	// `fullserverinfo` stufftext (e.g. "dm3"). Produced by the metadata node
	// (PopulateCore). It is the KTX-independent map identifier every

	// — read it through EffectiveMap, not directly. Empty when no serverinfo

//  3. the demoinfo name→team table to backfill a team when we have a name
//     but still no team (the KTX auth-name / late-join case).
