// WeaponPickupsAnalyzer records every slot-weapon acquisition and
// attaches an effectiveness metric — frags the picker scored with the
// weapon before their next death.
//
// Signal coverage:
//   - World-spawner pickups come from ItemPickupHintEvent (the KTX
//     //ktx took directive). ItemSpawnEvent gives us the entNum→Kind
//     map we need to classify the pickup. Only the six slot weapons
//     (rl, lg, gl, ssg, sng, ng) are recorded; armor / health /
//     powerup hints are ignored.
//   - Backpack pickups come from BackpackPickupHintEvent (the KTX
//     //ktx bp directive), paired with BackpackDropHintEvent for the
//     weapon attribution and the dropper's identity. Only RL and LG
//     packs get these hints, so SSG/NG/SNG/GL-only packs do not
//     appear here.
//   - In weapon-stay modes (deathmatch 2/3/5, coop — KTX weapon_touch's
//     `leave` flag, ktx/src/items.c:835) touched weapons keep their
//     model and the //ktx took hint is never emitted, so the two
//     signals above are blind for world weapon grabs. There the
//     analyzer synthesizes pickups from STAT_ITEMS weapon-bit 0→1
//     transitions instead, classifying source by proximity to a
//     weapon spawn entity ("world") or, failing that, "unknown"
//     (typically a non-RL/LG backpack grant, which has no hint of its
//     own). Synthesized entries carry Inferred=true.
//
// hadBefore is computed from the STAT_ITEMS bitfield maintained per
// slot: a pickup where the bit is already set is a redundant grab
// (most commonly a teammate-denial pickup). Kills counting ignores
// the distinction — if the picker frags with the weapon between
// pickup and next death, the entry gets the credit whether the weapon
// was fresh or already in inventory.
//
// Kills attribution uses ctx.FragEntries (populated by FragAnalyzer
// during Finalize), so this analyzer MUST be registered after
// FragAnalyzer in the default registry.
