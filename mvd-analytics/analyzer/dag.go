import "fmt"

// This file makes the analyzer pipeline's previously-implicit dependency
// DAG explicit as data (Stage 1 of PLAN-improve-analytics.md §5). Each
// analyzer and post-processor is wrapped in a nodeSpec declaring what
// artifacts it Requires and Provides; the engine validates the wiring
// and derives a deterministic execution order from it instead of relying
// on hand-ordered registration slices.
//
// The execution order is derived purely from the declared edges; the
// output is a pure function of the demo under ANY valid topological
// order (TestOrderIndependence), so registration order is inventory,
// not a correctness mechanism. Post-processors still
// mutate the assembled Result in place — every one is flagged
// Mutates:true as a temporary marker of the debt Stage 2 (the clock /
// roster refactor) removes.
//
// The out-of-band lazy pass ComputeLOS (los.go) is modelled as a lazy DAG node
// since Stage 3 (materialize.go): a nodeSpec with Lazy:true, registered in
// lazyArtifacts rather than in the eager analyzer / post-processor slices. It
// does NOT enter analyzeSource's execution order (r.specs / r.nodes stay the 21 eager
// nodes), so the eager bundle and the golden corpus are unchanged; it appears
// in -graph output marked lazy and is materialised on demand through the
// LazyArtifact hooks (mvd-api's per-artifact tier-3 cache). (The spatial
// weapon-fire streams were a second lazy node until phase 12 folded them into
// the eager parse — see materialize.go.)

// nodeSpec is one pipeline node declared as data: an analyzer's Finalize
// or a post-processor, with the artifact edges the engine schedules on.
//
// Artifacts are plain string names. Every node provides an artifact
// named after itself (so any node can be depended on by name), plus any
// extra artifacts it publishes. The two fix-up post-processors publish a
// FINAL artifact beyond their own name — "frags:final" (frags-final) and
// "match:final" (match-final) — so an in-pipeline consumer wanting the
// recovered / corrected value requires the ":final" name and can never
// silently bind the raw producer's pre-fix-up output. Requires names the
// artifacts a node's Finalize / post-processor reads.
