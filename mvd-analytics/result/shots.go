// ShotsResult is the per-shot weapon-fire stream plus per-player/weapon
// aggregates. A "shot" is one discrete weapon fire as observed on the wire:
// for SG/SSG/RL/GL/NG/SNG it is one svc_sound fire event on the shooter's
// CHAN_WEAPON (the sound carries the firing entity); for LG — the one
// weapon with no per-shot fire sound — it is one TE_LIGHTNING2 beam
// (KTX emits exactly one per fire tick), flagged Source="beam".
//
// The Shots stream is match-gated at the source (schema v50): warmup and
// post-match fires are dropped before the stream is built, so Shots and
// the ByPlayer aggregates come from the same in-match fire set and
// Reconciliation against demoInfo accuracy is meaningful.
type ShotsResult struct {
	// Shots is every detected fire, chronological, match-relative ms.
	Shots []Shot `json:"shots"`
	// ByPlayer holds match-time per-weapon counts and (hitscan) accuracy.
	ByPlayer []PlayerShots `json:"byPlayer,omitempty"`
	// Reconciliation cross-checks detected counts against KTX's
	// authoritative acc.attacks; nil when no demoInfo is present (non-KTX).

}

// Shot is one weapon fire. Time is match-relative milliseconds (same clock
// as DamageEntry.Time). Weapon is the lowercase KTX weapon name
// ("axe","sg","ssg","ng","sng","gl","rl","lg"). Source is "sound" (a
// CHAN_WEAPON fire sound) or "beam" (an LG TE_LIGHTNING2 bolt).
//
// Hit/Victims are populated for the linkable same-frame weapons: the
// hitscan set (sg/ssg/lg), whose damage lands in the fire's own server
// frame, and the axe, whose traceline runs exactly 200ms after the swing
// sound (the third 0.1s animation think) and links through that delayed
// window. Both link
// truthfully via the KTX damage stream, and for projectile fires whose
// tracked flight (entity spawn→despawn) brackets back to the fire and
// forward to impact damage — rl/gl on every parse, ng/sng only when nail
// decoding was enabled. On non-KTX servers there is no damage stream, so
// Hit is always false.
//
// The stream is match-only (schema v50; the pre-v50 Warmup field is gone) —
// every entry is an in-match fire.
//
// VictimKinds classifies each Victims entry — "enemy", "team" (same non-empty
// team as the shooter, not self) or "self" (victim slot == attacker slot, an
// rl/gl self-splash such as a rocket jump) — mirroring the Damage layer's
// IsSelf/IsTeam semantics. Omitted when every victim is an enemy (the common
// case); when present it is parallel to Victims.
//
// FlightEnd publishes the fire→flight half of the projectile link (schema
// v74): the time the tracked rocket/grenade/nail this fire launched died. It
// is the evidence Hit rests on for a projectile weapon, and it is set whether
// or not that impact damaged anyone — so a consumer with no wire damage stream
// can still tell a fire whose projectile WAS tracked (and when it landed) from
// one that never broadcast an entity at all. Absent on hitscan fires, and on a
// projectile fire whose flight was never tracked: an entity the server never
// broadcast (a rocket that detonates in the muzzle frame), a flight still open
// when the recording ended, or — for ng/sng — a parse without nail decoding.
