// ShotsResult is the per-shot weapon-fire stream plus per-player/weapon
// aggregates. A "shot" is one discrete weapon fire as observed on the wire:
// for SG/SSG/RL/GL/NG/SNG it is one svc_sound fire event on the shooter's
// CHAN_WEAPON (the sound carries the firing entity); for LG it is one cell
// consumed (no per-shot fire sound exists), inferred from the cell-ammo
// stat and flagged Source="ammo".
//
// The raw Shots stream is NOT match-gated — warmup fires are real signal and
// consumers window by Time. ByPlayer aggregates ARE match-gated (KTX
// scoreboard parity) so Reconciliation against demoInfo accuracy is
// meaningful.
type ShotsResult struct {
	// Shots is every detected fire, chronological, match-relative ms.
	Shots []Shot `json:"shots"`
	// ByPlayer holds match-time per-weapon counts and (hitscan) accuracy.
	ByPlayer []PlayerShots `json:"byPlayer,omitempty"`
	// Reconciliation cross-checks detected counts against KTX's
	// authoritative acc.attacks; nil when no demoInfo is present (non-KTX).
	Reconciliation *ShotsReconciliation `json:"reconciliation,omitempty"`
}

// Shot is one weapon fire. Time is match-relative milliseconds (same clock
// as DamageEntry.Time). Weapon is the lowercase KTX weapon name
// ("sg","ssg","ng","sng","gl","rl","lg"). Source is "sound" (a CHAN_WEAPON
// fire sound) or "ammo" (LG cell decrement).
//
// Hit/Victims are populated only for instantaneous hitscan weapons
// (sg/ssg/lg), where the shot and its damage land in the same server frame
// and can be linked truthfully via the KTX damage stream. Projectile fires
// (rl/gl/ng/sng) are left unlinked here — they have travel time and are
// linked by the entity-tracking phase. On non-KTX servers there is no
// damage stream, so Hit is always false.
//
// Warmup is true for fires outside the match (prewar / warmup / post-match) —
// the stream keeps them, but the ByPlayer aggregates and match-time consumers
// (e.g. the aim analysis) exclude them. Match-time fires omit the field.

// per cell-tick for LG (ktx/src/weapons.c). StreamAttacks converts our
// discrete StreamShots into that same unit (×6 SG, ×14 SSG, ×1 otherwise)
// so StreamAttacks and KtxAttacks are directly comparable; a large gap flags
// a detection problem (or a non-standard mode such as yawnmode SSG).
