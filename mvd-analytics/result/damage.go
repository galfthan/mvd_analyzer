// DamageResult holds per-hit damage and derived aggregates, reconstructed
// from the KTX mvdhidden_dmgdone stream (see mvd-reader MVD_FORMAT.md).
//
// Two damage families exist side by side. The RAW family (Damage, Given,
// Taken, ...) carries the wire value: UNBOUND damage including overkill,
// capped only at 9999, exactly as KTX multicasts it (unbound_dmg_dealt,
// ktx/src/combat.c:795). The BOUNDED family (Events[].Bounded and each
// player's Bounded nest) is reconstructed per hit to KTX's scoreboard
// semantics — armor absorbed + health damage capped to the victim's
// remaining health (dmg_dealt, combat.c:783). The wire does not carry the
// bounded value, but it does reveal it almost exactly: a hit the victim
// SURVIVES has no overkill, so bounded == raw identically; a KILLING hit's
// overkill is the end-of-frame death broadcast (bounded = raw + deathValue,
// the armor share cancelling). The residual slop is small and confined to
// three cases: same-frame multi-hit deaths (one death value cascaded across
// the frame's hits with an approximate save split), the -99 corpse-health
// clamp and respawn-masked deaths (both falling back to an approximate
// shadow-health cap), and the pent/tp save-share estimate. DamageReconciliation
// cross-checks both families against the KTX scoreboard.
//
// Telefrags and stomps are NOT weapon damage: they are positional instant
// kills (teleporting onto a player; landing on their head). The wire reports
// a telefrag as the 9999 cap, which would otherwise dominate the attacker's
// ByWeapon / EWep and the totals; a stomp is a movement kill, not a
// weapon. Both are excluded from the Events log, ByWeapon, Matrix, EWep and
// TotalDamage, and surfaced separately in Telefrags / Stomps (and as the
// opt-in "telefrag" / "stomp" events in view.Events). The kill still appears
// in FragResult / the "frag" event.
//
// Their DAMAGE does fold into Given/GivenTeam/Taken in both families,
// matching KTX's own accumulation (combat.c:1046-1076 maps them to wpNONE —
// in dmg totals, out of per-weapon ones): a telefrag folds its Bounded
// reconstruction (armor + remaining health) into the raw family too, since
// the wire 9999 is a sentinel; a stomp folds its honest wire value (raw) /
// reconstruction (bounded). An ENEMY positional kill also folds into the
// victim-weapon EnemyVs*/EWep buckets — KTX's dmg_eweapon accumulation has
// no deathtype gate either (combat.c:1073), so a kill on an RL/LG holder
// lands in EWep. ByWeapon, Matrix and TotalDamage stay excluded (the wpNONE
// parity). On a skipped:* demo the reversal is total: no fold at all, so
// given/taken and the buckets revert to pure v53 exclusion.
