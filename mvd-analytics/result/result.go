// Package result defines the stable JSON contract produced by running a
// qwanalytics pipeline over a qwdemo.events.Source. Every analyzer's
// Finalize output is a value defined in this package; the top-level
// Result struct is the aggregate returned by the pipeline.
//
// Consumers of qwanalytics (web UI, CLIs, AI agents) should depend on
// this package directly and stay indifferent to where each sub-result
// is computed. The JSON schema is versioned via SchemaVersion so JS
// callers can feature-detect breaking changes.
package result

// CurrentSchemaVersion identifies the JSON schema shape. Bump on any
// breaking change to the outward data the pipeline serves — both the
// Result structure / its sub-types AND the on-demand view/query wire
// surface (Buckets, Events, StreamSlice, StateAt, LocTrails,
// RegionControl), which is served identically via WASM, CLI, the REST
// API, and MCP. Consumers pin or switch on this value to feature-detect
// breaking changes; it is also the REST API's ETag / X-Schema-Version,
// so a bump invalidates cached view responses.
//
// v4 adds Backpacks: a list of RL/LG backpack drops sourced from
// KTX's //ktx drop STUFFCMD_DEMOONLY directive. Pickup tracking is
// intentionally deferred until the wire-flutter reliability issue
// is resolved — see qwanalytics/analyzer/backpacks.go for the full
// reasoning.
//
// v5 adds WeaponPickups: a list of slot-weapon acquisition events
// (world spawners via //ktx took, RL/LG backpacks via //ktx bp)
// with an effectiveness metric — kills with the weapon before the
// picker's next death. Backpack pickups carry BackpackEnt which pairs
// with Backpacks[i].EntNum so frontends can join drop ↔ pickup.
//
// v6:
//   - HighResPlayerData adds GL, Shells, Nails (sh/nl/gl JSON keys);
//     HighResTeamData adds GL.
//   - MatchEvent adds MessageClean (markup-stripped chat text); raw
//     Message preserved.
//   - RegionControlResult adds explicit Locs[] on each region plus
//     TeamA/TeamB labels, BucketStates (compact one-char-per-bucket)
//     and Stats (match-aggregate percentages) — region control is now
//     computed in Go and re-callable via WASM.
//   - Top-level Result.Duration removed (use Match.Duration or
//     DemoInfo.Duration).
//   - MatchResult.PlayerStat drops dead Kills/Deaths fields (always
//     0; consumers read FragResult.ByPlayer or DemoInfoResult).
//
// v7:
//   - Adds Result.Streams: the canonical event-rate storage for every
//     per-player field (vitals, weapons, powerups, ammo, position,
//     loc, spawns, deaths). Sparse change streams + half-open
//     intervals + columnar position track. See qwanalytics/result/streams.go.
//   - Removes TimelineAnalysisResult.HighResBuckets and
//     TimelineAnalysisResult.HighResDuration. Bucketed data is now
//     produced on demand by qwanalytics/view.Buckets at any window
//     resolution, with per-field reducers selected by the caller.
//   - Removes RegionControlResult.BucketStates from the parse-time
//     output. View-time callers (CLI -view region-control, WASM
//     recomputeRegionControl) get it on demand at the requested
//     resolution.
//   - Health/Armor change streams use int16 (Quake values reach 250,
//     above int8 range).
//
// v8:
//   - PositionTrack.T changes from []float32 seconds to []int32
//     milliseconds. PlayerStream.Spawns / Deaths change from []float64
//     seconds to []int32 milliseconds. JSON keys unchanged; consumers
//     reading these as seconds must scale by 1/1000. The integer-ms
//     unit is what the MVD wire format already carries (1-byte ms
//     delta per message); keeping it integer eliminates the float-
//     precision drift that caused spurious teleport edges in locgraph
//     when a respawn boundary and a position sample shared the same
//     wire timestamp but disagreed by ~1e-6 after float roundtrip.
//   - Other timestamped result fields (ChangeI16.T, Interval.Start/End,
//     MatchEvent.Time, frag/powerup event times) remain float64
//     seconds — they don't participate in the boundary comparison
//     that motivated this change.
//
// v9:
//   - Loc attribution gains visibility awareness (V6 algorithm in
//     mvd-analytics/locvis). When a BSP is available for the demo's
//     map the analyzer rejects candidate loc-points that fall outside
//     the player's potentially-visible-set, eliminating the brief
//     "wall-bleed" phantom loc visits V1's pure-Euclidean nearest-
//     neighbour produced. Maps without a BSP fall back to V1 unchanged.
//     Affected fields: PlayerStream.Loc (li), Backpacks[i].Loc,
//     ItemTimeline[i].Loc, plus everything derived from those
//     (LocTrails, LocGraph edges, RegionControl). Field shapes are
//     unchanged — only the contents shift for maps with BSPs.
//
// v10:
//   - DeathEvent / SpawnEvent gain two new signal sources beyond the
//     v9 StatHealth-crossing detector:
//     1. The DF_DEAD bit in svc_playerinfo (broadcast every frame
//     for every player), captured in mvd-reader/parser/position.go.
//     2. Victim-prefix and infix obituary prints (rocketed by,
//     telefragged by, "Satan's power deflects X's telefrag", the
//     CRMod-added "disembowled" / "shish-kebabed" / etc. set,
//     KTX's k_spawnicide variants) matched in
//     mvd-reader/parser/obituary.go and consumed in parsePrint,
//     gated on a parser-internal match-started flag so warmup
//     obits cannot pre-seed dedup state.
//     The first two sources flow through maybeEmitDeath /
//     maybeEmitSpawn which dedupe against each other. The obit path
//     uses forceEmitDeath instead, bypassing dedup, because KTX's
//     own deathcount (logfrag) can increment without any visible
//     DF_DEAD / stat transition on the wire — the most common case
//     being a Satan-pent deflection (dtTELE2) that fires against a
//     player whose entity state never visibly leaves the previous
//     dead interval. Cross-validated end-to-end against KTX's
//     authoritative demoinfo `stats.deaths` scoreboard. Field shapes
//     are unchanged; PlayerStream.Spawns / Deaths counts rise for
//     affected demos and downstream LocGraph, LocTrails,
//     RegionControl, WeaponPickups, and streak boundaries shift
//     accordingly.
//
// v11:
//   - Bucket views gain a column-major layout (view.ColumnarBuckets):
//     for each (player, field) one dense typed array over the player's
//     active span, with an implicit time axis (time(i) =
//     startMs + i*windowMs), a 0/1 alive[] liveness mask, a sparse
//     per-field validFrom, and booleans/alive emitted as 0/1. It becomes
//     the default for the web (getDefaultBuckets), the REST /buckets
//     endpoint, and MCP getBuckets; the row-major view.BucketsView stays
//     available via layout=row. Columnar always emits the raw loc index.
//   - Removes the legacy HighResBucket / HighResPlayerData /
//     HighResTeamData shim and view.ToLegacyHighResBuckets (the v6 WASM
//     bridge shape). The Result *structure* is unchanged; this bump
//     versions the outward view/query wire surface so API / MCP / web
//     consumers can feature-detect the new default bucket shape and
//     cached view responses are invalidated.
//
// v12:
//   - LocGraph nodes and edges gain optional Armed / Unarmed / Quad / Pent
//     weights: the same Total / ByPlayer / ByTeam time (node) and
//     transition-count (edge) breakdown restricted to samples where the
//     player held RL or LG (Armed), held neither (Unarmed), or had an
//     active Quad / Pent powerup. Additive and backward-compatible (all
//     omitempty), but the bump invalidates cached loc-graph responses so
//     consumers pick them up.
//
// v13:
//   - New MapEntities section: the map's static designed layout (item
//     spawns, player spawnpoints, teleport destinations/sources,
//     buttons) with type + location, sourced from the offline-generated
//     mapents corpus (BSP entity lumps) keyed by map name. Additive
//     (omitempty); absent when no corpus exists for the map.
//
// v14:
//   - MapEntities gains brush entities — teleportSrc (trigger_teleport),
//     button (func_button), door (func_door) — placed at their BSP
//     submodel bbox centre with a Bounds (trigger/door volume), plus the
//     teleport source→destination link via MapEntity.Target ==
//     teleportDst.TargetName. v13 carried point entities only.
//
// v15:
//   - TimelineAnalysis gains DeathEvents: a per-player death stream
//     ({time, player, team}) parallel to FragEvents, sourced from the
//     authoritative protocol DeathEvent (every death counts once), for
//     the Timeline tab's per-player frags/deaths drill-down and KTX-style
//     efficiency = frags/(frags+deaths). Additive and omitempty, but the
//     bump invalidates cached timeline responses so consumers pick it up.
//
// v16:
//   - PlayerFrags gains TeamKills (KTX "tk") and teamkills re-enter
//     Frags.Frags as complete killer↔victim pairs (previously dropped
//     because the obituary names only one party). Killer-named teamkills
//     ("X loses another friend") recover the victim by matching the
//     coincident authoritative DeathEvent on the killer's team;
//     victim-named ones ("X was telefragged by his teammate") recover the
//     killer by combining position co-location with the teamkiller's −1
//     frag-delta. The messages stream also now tags Satan's-power-deflect
//     self-telefrags as frag events (one frag event per death). Additive,
//     but the bump invalidates cached frag responses so consumers pick it
//     up.
//
// v17:
//   - Self-kill weapon labels in Frags.Frags are no longer flattened to
//     "suicide": only the /kill console command ("X suicides", −2 frags)
//     keeps weapon "suicide"; weapon self-detonations now carry their real
//     weapon (rl/gl/lg) with IsSuicide set, matching the messages stream.
//   - Frags.ByWeapon is now enemy kills only (suicides/teamkills excluded),
//     so self-detonations under their real weapon don't inflate kills.
//   - Recovered teamkills no longer carry a stale IsSuicide flag (the "X
//     gets a frag for the other team" case). Bump invalidates cached frag
//     responses so consumers pick up the relabeled weapons.
//
// v18:
//   - TimelineAnalysis gains KillEvents: a per-player enemy-kill stream
//     ({time, player, team}) keyed on the killer, parallel to DeathEvents,
//     sourced from the canonical frag log (FragEntries) and filtered to
//     real enemy kills (suicides/teamkills excluded). Lets the Timeline
//     tab's per-player drill-down plot an exact cumulative kills−deaths
//     +/- that reconciles with byPlayer.kills and kills-based efficiency.
//     Additive and omitempty, but the bump invalidates cached timeline
//     responses so consumers pick it up.
//
// v19:
//   - MatchResult.PlayerStat gains Kills, Deaths and Suicides: the
//     frag-log-corrected counts, so MatchResult.Players is a complete
//     corrected scoreboard rather than just the net frag tally. They
//     supersede the KTX demoinfo stats, which credit several self/positional
//     deaths to the wrong entity — pentagram-deflect telefrags (dtTELE2)
//     inflate the deflector's kills, and world-dealt suicides (fall/lava/
//     squish/drown) bump the world entity's counter, not the victim's
//     (ktx/src/client.c:5132), so demoinfo undercounts suicides. 0 when the
//     demo carried no frag log. The API /overview player rows surface the
//     same Kills/Deaths/Suicides so non-web consumers get the correction the
//     web UI already applied. Field additions only.
//
// v20:
//   - New Damage (DamageResult) section: per-hit damage log + aggregates
//     (attacker→victim matrix, per-weapon, given/taken, and the EWep
//     victim-weapon buckets enemyVsSg/Mid/Lg/Rl/Both where ewep=lg+rl+both)
//     reconstructed from the KTX mvdhidden_dmgdone stream, plus a scoreboard
//     cross-check vs demoInfo.players[].dmg. Positional kills (telefrag,
//     stomp) are excluded from all damage figures and surfaced separately
//     (Damage.Telefrags/Stomps, opt-in telefrag/stomp events). Also a
//     Layer-1 change: world/environmental damage-taken is emitted with an
//     Attacker == -1 "world" sentinel rather than dropped. Additive
//     (omitempty); absent when the demo lacks the KTX hidden-damage stream.
//
// v21:
//   - TimelineAnalysis gains a wall-clock anchor for the demo timeline:
//     demoStartUnixMs (server clock, Unix epoch ms, at demo open / t=0)
//     plus demoStartAccuracyMs (its resolution: 1 from the mvdhidden
//     0x000B millisecond block, 1000 from the whole-second serverinfo
//     `epoch` cvar). With the existing demoOffset, a consumer maps any
//     match-relative game time to wall clock for syncing external data
//     (voice, stream overlays). Additive (omitempty); absent when the
//     demo carries no wall-clock source.
//
// v22:
//   - TimelineAnalysis gains pauses[]: per-pause {atMs, durationMs} segments
//     recovered from the mvdhidden 0x000A (paused_duration) blocks mvdsv
//     embeds once per idle frame while paused. The game clock freezes during
//     a pause, so the v21 wall-clock formula drifted by the total pause time
//     on paused demos; folding Σ durationMs for atMs <= g into the mapping
//     fixes it. The parser now decodes 0x000A (it omits the standard hidden
//     block-length header — a bare type_id+byte — so it is read via a
//     dedicated path). Additive (omitempty); absent when the demo has no
//     pauses or was recorded by a server that does not embed the block.
//
// v23:
//   - Move the wall-clock/timing anchor from timelineAnalysis to
//     streams.global (breaking move, not additive): demoOffset,
//     demoStartUnixMs, demoStartAccuracyMs, pauses now live there next to
//     matchStart/matchEnd (the match window they time). The redundant
//     timelineAnalysis.matchStartTime (always 0, duplicated by
//     streams.global.matchStart) is dropped. timelineAnalysis keeps its
//     event-shaped data + map metadata, including locTable. The /overview
//     REST endpoint gains a `timing` block exposing the wall-clock anchor to
//     REST/MCP consumers (previously only the in-process WASM build could
//     read it).
//
// v24:
//   - PositionTrack gains an H column: the player's height above the
//     floor directly beneath them at each native-rate sample (feet above
//     the nearest solid surface below), from a straight-down trace
//     through the map's worldspawn player clip hull. The hull is parsed
//     from the map's BSP CLIPNODES at analyze time by the new mapclip
//     package, with BSP bytes from the same best-effort source as the
//     visibility-aware loc filter (the shared mapbsp loader) — no
//     generated corpus. H reads ~0 when grounded and grows during a jump
//     / airborne hit (airgib), so consumers flag those directly; the
//     absolute floor is Z - 24 - H if needed. Sentinel result.NoFloor
//     marks samples with no floor to measure from (void/pit, or a moving
//     brush model such as the dm2 lift, which the worldspawn-only hull
//     excludes). Additive (omitempty); absent when no BSP is provisioned
//     for the map.
//
// v25:
//   - TimelineAnalysis gains airgibs[]: the top airborne rocket hits
//     (AirgibEvent) for Key Moments — each DIRECT enemy rocket hit (splash
//     excluded) whose victim was >= 96 units above the floor (≈ two player
//     models), annotated with attacker/victim (name, team, userid), the
//     hit time, the victim's loc and height, raw damage, and whether it
//     was lethal (a matching rocket frag near the hit). Derived by a
//     post-processor from result.Damage (per-hit log) + the streams'
//     PositionTrack.H column + the frag log; capped and sorted by height
//     descending. Additive (omitempty); empty when the map has no clip
//     hull (no H column) so no airborne height can be computed.
//
// v26:
//   - PositionTrack.H is now measured over the player's bounding-box
//     footprint, not just the origin column: the height is taken to the
//     highest floor found under a 3x3 grid of columns sampled ±8 around
//     the origin (mapclip HeightAboveFloorBox). On the already-±16-box-
//     inflated hull that is an effective ~48-wide footprint — the true
//     box plus a small safety band. A player skimming a ledge
//     / well rim — origin momentarily over the pit while the box overhangs
//     the rim — now reads the near floor (small H) instead of plunging to
//     the distant floor far below. Same shape and units; only values near
//     ledges change, which also removes the bogus high airgibs those
//     samples produced (e.g. anwalked RA's well rim logged a 553-unit
//     airgib that was really a rim skim).
//
// v27:
//   - PositionTrack.H now stands players on moving brush-model entities
//     (lifts, doors, trains): the parser surfaces "*N" submodel entities
//     as MoverSpawn/MoverState events, and the floor trace runs over the
//     worldspawn hull PLUS each mover's submodel clip hull posed at its
//     demo-streamed origin for the sample's timestamp (mapclip
//     HeightAboveFloorBoxScene) — the highest floor wins. A player
//     riding the dm2 RA lift reads ~0 instead of the height to the
//     shaft floor, which also removes the false "airgib" entries rocket
//     hits on lift riders produced (dm2 "path.lift"/"Quad.button", dm3
//     "lifts"). NoFloor accordingly narrows: "on a moving brush model"
//     disappears as a cause, leaving void/pit, embedded and zero
//     origins. Same shape and units; only values over movers change.
//
// v28:
//   - PositionTrack gains an Lq column: per-sample liquid state, packed
//     (type << 2) | level — level 1-3 (feet/waist/eyes submerged,
//     mirroring the engine's PM_CategorizePosition probes against the
//     map's render BSP), type LqWater/LqSlime/LqLava (water 5/6/7,
//     slime 9/10/11, lava 13/14/15; 0 = dry). Decode with
//     result.LqLevel / result.LqType. Additive (omitempty); absent when
//     no BSP is provisioned.
//   - H interacts with liquids: a sample in liquid (Lq level >= 1)
//     reads H = 0 by definition (the surface is the support — swimmers
//     in the dm3 pool no longer read as airborne over the pool bottom),
//     and a dry sample airborne above water/slime/lava measures down to
//     the liquid surface when it is the highest support beneath the
//     player (bspvis.LiquidSurfaceBelow).
//
// v29:
//   - AirgibEvent gains heightAboveAttacker: the victim's origin minus
//     the shooter's at the hit (units; negative = victim below) — the
//     vertical gap the rocket climbed, often the more impressive number
//     for a highlight than the floor height. From the two players'
//     nearest position samples to the hit; 0/omitted when the shooter
//     had no sample near the hit. Ranking and the >= 96 threshold still
//     use the floor height; the web table adds a sortable column.
//
// v30:
//   - TimelineAnalysis.Airgibs is no longer capped at the top 20: every
//     hit that qualifies (direct enemy rocket, victim >= 96 units above
//     the floor) is emitted, still sorted by floor height descending.
//     The qualification threshold already bounds the list to a handful
//     per match, and a cap keyed on floor height could drop the hits a
//     consumer sorting by heightAboveAttacker cares about most.
//
// v31:
//   - PositionTrack gains VP/VYa columns: the player's view direction
//     (pitch, yaw) per sample as the raw angle16 wire shorts, kept
//     losslessly. Decode to degrees with float(uint16(v)) * 360/65536
//     (values in [0,360); pitch > 180 = looking up). Roll is not stored
//     (the server forces it to 0). Additive (omitempty), populated
//     whenever the position track is. New view-layer field codes expose
//     them: `view` (vp/vya), plus `hgt` (h) and `lq` split out so a
//     consumer can request height/liquid/view without x/y/z — and `pos`
//     now returns strictly x/y/z (h/lq no longer ride along it).
//
// v32:
//   - PositionTrack gains VX/VY/VZ columns: the player's velocity per
//     sample in Quake units/sec, derived from the position columns by a
//     central-difference estimator (it does not differentiate across a
//     respawn teleport or an abnormal time gap, so it reads ~0 there
//     instead of spiking). Additive (omitempty), populated whenever the
//     track is — no BSP needed. New opt-in view-layer field code `vel`
//     (vx/vy/vz) and CLI `-include velocity`. Expect ±1-unit
//     quantization noise on the raw derivative (integer-rounded source
//     positions); smooth client-side for a clean speed curve.
//
// v33:
//   - PositionTrack X/Y/Z, VX/VY/VZ and H change from int32 to float32,
//     so we stop truncating the wire-native sub-unit origin (mvd-reader
//     decodes coordinates as float32; the wire carries eighth-unit fixed
//     point or true floats). Velocity, derived by central difference, is
//     now sub-unit precise too — the old ±1-unit quantization noise from
//     integer-rounded source positions is gone. The PositionTrack.H
//     NoFloor sentinel changes from -2147483648 (math.MinInt32, which
//     float32 cannot represent exactly and serializes as -2147483600) to
//     -1000000000 (-1e9, exact in float32 and float64). Time axes stay
//     int32 ms; view angles stay int16 (raw angle16); loc/liquid columns
//     unchanged.
//
// v34:
//   - TimelineAnalysis.LocationData now carries one MapLocation per loc
//     name — the medoid of that name's corpus points — instead of every
//     raw .loc point. The .loc corpus often repeats a name across several
//     nearby points, which drew duplicate map labels; the medoid is the
//     actual point minimizing summed distance to its same-name siblings
//     (never an averaged mid-air position). Same field name and shape;
//     the list is shorter. locgraph already read one point per name.
//
// v35:
//   - Streams gains Movers []MoverStream: the pose timeline of every
//     tracked brush-model entity (lift, door, plat, train). Each carries
//     EntNum, SubModel (the "*N" brush-model index, matching the corpus
//     SubModelMesh ID), and index-aligned T/X/Y/Z/Vis columns — the
//     mover sits at (X,Y,Z)[i] at T[i] ms and is drawn when Vis[i].
//     Origins are float32 (exact 1/8-unit wire values). Times are
//     match-relative; the first entry is clamped to t=0 carrying the
//     match-start pose so a parked mover (whose only wire state predates
//     the match) still has one. Additive (omitempty); absent when the
//     demo has no movers. The same internal mover tracks already feed the
//     v27 floor-height pass.
//
// v36:
//   - MatchResult drops the dead StartTime / EndTime fields. After the
//     match-relative time normalization StartTime was always 0 (already
//     omitempty, so absent from JSON) and EndTime always equalled
//     Duration; both duplicated streams.global.matchStart/matchEnd. The
//     `endTime` key disappears from the `match` object — read Duration for
//     match length, or streams.global for the match window. Breaking
//     removal (not additive); the view query API is unaffected.
//
// v37:
//   - PlayerStream gains LOS []LosTrack: per-opponent line-of-sight as
//     half-open [Start,End) ms intervals during which the looker had a clear
//     sightline (origin+(0,0,22) eye → any of the opponent's 8 bbox corners +
//     midpoint), blocked by worldspawn solids or any active mover posed in
//     the way. Asymmetric (A→B in A's stream, B→A in B's); Other indexes
//     Streams.Players. Computed against the visibility BSP, so present only on
//     maps with a provisioned BSP (same gate as PositionTrack.H/Lq). Additive
//     (omitempty); absent on BSP-less maps. View direction is not considered.
//     Computed lazily (analyzer.ComputeLOS) — NOT during the default parse,
//     since it is the heaviest position-derived pass — and so absent unless a
//     consumer requested it (web LOS overlay, qw-analyze -include los,
//     mvd-api /los). The Streams.LOSComputed guard (gob-only, json:"-") makes
//     it idempotent.
//
// v38:
//   - PlayerStream gains PVS []LosTrack alongside LOS: per-opponent
//     potentially-visible-set intervals reproducing the server's per-client
//     entity cull (mvdsv SV_PlayerVisibleToClient) — the looker's fat PVS
//     (CM_FatPVS of origin+view_ofs) ∩ the opponent's entity leaf set (expanded
//     box, non-solid), or always when it overflows MAX_ENT_LEAFS. I.e. whether a
//     live server would have sent that opponent to the client (the recorded MVD
//     itself stores every entity, pvs = NULL). Same LosTrack shape, same lazy
//     pass (analyzer.ComputeLOS), BSP gate and Streams.LOSComputed guard as LOS.
//     This test also gates the LOS raycast, so PVS ⊇ LOS by construction: the
//     gap is the occlusion-tolerant "on the wire but no clear ray" signal.
//     Additive (omitempty); absent on BSP-less maps and on the default parse.
//
// v39:
//   - New top-level Shots *ShotsResult: a per-shot weapon-fire stream
//     (who fired what, at exactly what match-relative ms) derived from
//     svc_sound CHAN_WEAPON fire sounds (SG/SSG/RL/GL/NG/SNG) and LG cell
//     decrements, with same-frame hitscan→damage linking (sg/ssg/lg) and a
//     diagnostic reconciliation against KTX acc.attacks. Additive
//     (omitempty); the stream is present whenever any fire is detected,
//     even on non-KTX servers (no damage stream → no hit links).
//
// v40:
//   - Streams gains two opt-in spatial weapon-fire streams for the map view:
//     Streams.Projectiles (every tracked rocket/grenade flight as
//     spawn→despawn segments + times) and Streams.Beams (every LG
//     TE_LIGHTNING2 bolt as a muzzle→impact segment + time). Both are built
//     only when requested (qw-analyze -include projectiles,beams; the WASM
//     map build) so the default output and goldens stay lean. Additive
//     (omitempty); absent from the default parse.
//
// v41:
//   - New top-level Aim (*AimResult): per-player aim analysis derived as a
//     post-process from Shots + Streams (interpolated position/view at fire
//     time) + Damage + the LG beam stream — normalized crosshair-error
//     samples (hitscan), LG ramp-onto-target, rocket direct/splash, LG
//     reach/whiff. Additive (omitempty); the crosshair/ramp blocks compute
//     by default, the rocket/reach blocks only when their streams were built.
//
// v42:
//   - Shot gains Warmup: true for fires outside the match (prewar / warmup /
//     post-match). The shot stream still keeps them; ByPlayer and the aim
//     analysis exclude them. Additive (omitempty).
//
// v43:
//   - Aim target attribution gates candidates on being alive at fire time
//     (losAliveAt over the spawn/death streams). Dead players keep streaming
//     position samples (the death-anim body), so a corpse could previously
//     win nearest-crosshair attribution in team games. No field changes;
//     crosshair sample counts/targets shift on team demos, and a duel fire
//     while the lone enemy is dead no longer emits a sample.
//
// v44:
//   - Aim crosshair samples of hit shots attribute to the server-confirmed
//     victim (nearest by crosshair error when a pellet fire hit several),
//     bypassing the v43 liveness gate and the enemy filter. The killing blow
//     lands in the same frame the victim dies, so the liveness gate read the
//     victim as already dead at the fire time and attributed the shot to the
//     nearest *other* live enemy — hits appeared tens of hull-widths off
//     target in team games, and duels dropped their killing-blow samples
//     entirely. No field changes; hit samples' tgt/dyaw/dpitch/nyaw/npitch/
//     dist shift, and duels gain one sample per hitscan kill.
//
// v45:
//   - Victim-class classification on the shots/aim pipeline, mirroring the
//     Damage layer's IsSelf/IsTeam semantics. Shot gains VictimKinds
//     (parallel to Victims: "enemy"/"team"/"self", omitted when all-enemy);
//     WeaponShots gains EnemyHits/TeamHits/SelfHits (overlapping buckets —
//     a multi-victim fire counts in each bucket it has a victim in);
//     CrosshairSamples and LGRampSamples gain a Team column; WeaponAim gains
//     Enemy/Team/Self *WeaponAimSplit hit-counter slices. All additive
//     (omitempty) — Hits/Accuracy stay all-victims for KTX parity.
//
// v46:
//   - Weapon-stay recovery (serverinfo deathmatch 2/3/5, or coop — the
//     standard duel/2on2 dmm3 included): KTX never emits `//ktx took` for
//     weapons in those modes and the weapon entity never leaves the wire,
//     so world weapon pickups were previously absent entirely. They are now
//     synthesized from STAT_ITEMS weapon-bit 0→1 transitions. WeaponPickup
//     gains Inferred (marks synthesized entries) and the Source vocabulary
//     gains "unknown" (a flip with no weapon pad in touch range — typically
//     a non-RL/LG backpack grant, which has no hint in any mode).
//   - ItemTimeline weapon phases in weapon-stay demos use a zero-length
//     unavailability convention: TakenAt == RespawnAt, with the next phase
//     opening at the same instant (the weapon never left the map).
//   - Duel team normalization now also rewrites Items phase teams,
//     WeaponPickups Team/DropperTeam, Backpacks Team, Shots stream/ByPlayer
//     teams (and transitively Aim teams), and Airgibs attacker/victim teams
//     — previously these kept the raw pre-normalization team strings in 1v1
//     demos, so team-keyed pickup aggregation bucketed under stale labels.
//     It also reclassifies Shot.VictimKinds "team" → "enemy" (folding the
//     WeaponShots TeamHits bucket into EnemyHits): victimKindOf compares
//     raw team strings, so a duel where both players share a colour team
//     classified every opponent hit as "team". Aim's enemy/team splits
//     follow via aimPost ordering.
//   - Item pickup attribution: the Layer-4 distance corroborator samples
//     positions from the per-frame history at the touch instant and all
//     proximity consumers share a measured 128 u touch gate (was a 256 u
//     stale-sample bound) — a handful of beyond-gate distance attributions
//     become honestly unattributed phases.
//
// v47:
//   - LG miss reclassification (WeaponAim). A miss only counts as Blocked
//     or OutOfRange when the shooter was on target: Blocked = the beam
//     stopped short of its ~600 u max range on geometry and its extension
//     to full range crosses a live enemy's collision hull (a would-be hit
//     denied by the obstruction); OutOfRange = the beam ran its full
//     length and its extension to infinity crosses a live enemy's hull
//     (denied by reach). Previously every short-of-max-range beam whose
//     endpoint wasn't near an enemy was Blocked (even fired into a wall
//     with nobody behind) and every full-length beam was OutOfRange.
//     NearMiss is removed: with blocked detection on the beam line, the
//     near/wide distinction among plain aim errors carried no signal —
//     all remaining whiffs land in the lg `miss` bucket (field shared
//     with the SG/SSG per-pellet Miss). LG invariant becomes
//     Hits + Blocked + Miss + OutOfRange + Unresolved == Shots.
//
// v48: correctness fixes to already-emitted values (no field shape change).
//   - timelineAnalysis.killEvents are now on the match-relative clock and
//     carry duel team labels, exactly like the sibling deathEvents/
//     fragEvents streams (both post-processors previously skipped them):
//     each kill was ~demoOffset ms late and, in 1v1s, tagged with a raw
//     colour team instead of the player name.
//   - Chat lines can no longer start or end the match: the match-timing
//     detector ignores PRINT_CHAT (level 3), so a pre-match "go!" or a
//     mid-match "gg game over" say no longer flips the match window (which
//     would shift matchStart/matchEnd and freeze/warp every stream).
//   - The CRMod "eats 2 scoops of" super-shotgun obituary is reachable
//     again: those kills were mislabeled `gl` with a phantom "2 scoops of X"
//     killer; now `ssg` with the real killer name.
//   - match.players/match.teams no longer drop players who finished on
//     exactly 0 frags (surface-authoritative-data); and duel detection trusts
//     demoInfo.players as authoritative, so a 2on2 in which two players end
//     on 0 frags is no longer misclassified as a duel and team-renamed.
//     Paired reader fix so spectators don't leak in instead: the full
//     userinfo parser now reads the server-set `*spectator` star key
//     (mvdsv strips the bare `spectator` key before broadcast) and resets
//     the flag on every full update, ezquake-style.
//   - Powerup interval end times use the same effective match end as the
//     weapon intervals on demos cut before intermission (were the per-player
//     last sample vs the global max).
//
// v49: aim/shots correctness fixes (no field shape change).
//   - aim.players[].weapons rl/gl direct/splash/missed is present on every
//     default parse: the block was gated on the opt-in streams.projectiles
//     emission, while the projectile linking it actually needs runs on every
//     parse — it now gates on linking evidence (any linked rl/gl fire).
//   - The damage records feeding aim's pellet and direct splits are windowed
//     to match time [0, matchEnd]: warmup and post-match damage no longer
//     inflates direct (and deflates splash).
//   - Duel damage classification: in a 1v1 where both players share a
//     non-empty colour team, damage.events[].isTeam was true for every hit
//     on the opponent — contradicting the duel-normalized shots victimKinds,
//     silently emptying timelineAnalysis.airgibs and zeroing the aim enemy
//     splits, and folding all given damage into givenTeam (empty matrix,
//     empty victimWep buckets). DamageAnalyzer now classifies duel hits as
//     enemy at birth, so events, aggregates, matrix and EWep buckets are
//     consistent with the rest of the duel-normalized result.
//   - Shots identity resolution uses the canonical ResolveSlotAt chain,
//     which backfills an empty team from the demoinfo name table even when
//     the name resolved (parity with damage/frags).
//   - match.players[].frags no longer clobbered by a post-match reconnect:
//     the svc_updatefrags scoreboard is frozen at match end, so a slot
//     re-init to 0 during intermission cannot erase the final score (the
//     v48 removal of the 0-frag filter had surfaced these corrupted zeros
//     as if they were real scores).
//
// v50: damage.events is now match-gated at the source.
//   - The per-hit damage.events log previously carried out-of-match (warmup /
//     post-match) hits while the aggregates gated them out. The analyzer now
//     drops out-of-match hits before appending to events, so the events log
//     and the aggregates are built from the same in-match hit set. This
//     removes the aim [0,matchEnd] self-window (v49) — aim reads exactly-in-
//     match damage — and fixes a latent airgibs bug that counted warmup /
//     post-match rocket airgibs (it iterated events with no gate). No field
//     shape change; damage.events arrays shrink by the out-of-match hits.
//
// v51: the match opening becomes first-class (PLAN-api-usability 16.1-A).
//   - streams.players[].sp gains the match-start spawn. KTX respawns every
//     player when the countdown ends (SM_PrepareClients → k_respawn,
//     ktx/src/match.c:881,972), but a player alive through the countdown
//     never crosses health ≤0→>0, so the parser's dead→alive detector
//     missed the first — most contested — spawn of the match. The timeline
//     now synthesizes a t=0 spawn for every player alive at match start
//     whose respawn wasn't wire-visible.
//   - Adds Result.Opening ("opening" artifact): each player's match-start
//     spawn location plus the first in-match take of every contested
//     spawner (armors, mega, powerups, RL/LG) — a pure projection of
//     items + streams kept small for one-call fetches.
//   - The events view (not stored, documented here for the contract) gains
//     the default "pickup" type — identity-rich pickups joined from
//     items[].phases (world takes, per-spawner ya_1/ya_2 naming) and
//     weaponPickups (backpack/unknown grants) — and spawn events now carry
//     the spawn location in detail.
//
// v52: no-match-start demos are flagged, not coerced.
//   - streams.global gains timeBase: "demo" (omitted normally) when no match
//     start was detected. On such demos the per-producer rebase never runs,
//     so every timestamp in the Result is on the raw demo clock — previously
//     indistinguishable from a match-rebased result. A matching entry is
//     appended to errors[] so /overview surfaces it without a new field.
//
// v53: columnar buckets become loc-self-contained (view shape only — no
//   stored field changes; bumped so the immutable schemaVersion-keyed
//   ETags stop revalidating the pre-legend bodies).
//   - The /buckets layout=column envelope gains locTable: the demo's
//     interned loc-name legend, present iff an "li" column is in the
//     output. Columnar keeps the compact raw index (unlike row mode,
//     which resolves names per bucket); the legend lets a consumer —
//     notably an MCP agent on the columnar default — decode locally
//     instead of a /loc-table round trip.
//
// v54: the bounded damage family (additive).
//   - The wire carries only KTX's UNBOUND damage (overkill-inclusive,
//     ktx/src/combat.c:795); the scoreboard's BOUNDED dmg_dealt (armor
//     absorbed + health damage capped to remaining health, combat.c:783)
//     is now reconstructed per hit from tracked victim armor/health state.
//     damage.events[].bounded (omitted when equal to damage; 0 is a real
//     value — a pent/teamplay-nullified hit), damage.byPlayer.<p>.bounded
//     (a nested PlayerDamage mirroring the damage figures), and
//     damage.scoreboard deltas gain a bounded nest incl. streamTeam /
//     scoreTeam (dmg.team reconciliation only becomes meaningful with the
//     bounded family). damage.dmg ("both") and damage.boundedMode
//     ("standard", or "skipped:midair|instagib|dmgfrags" when the server
//     mode rewrites T_Damage unobservably — no bounded fields then).
//   - Telefrags and stomps fold their BOUNDED damage into given/givenTeam/
//     taken in both families (telefrag: armor+health — the wire 9999 is a
//     sentinel; stomp: the honest ~10 HP wire value through the normal
//     arithmetic), matching KTX's own accumulation (combat.c:1046-1076
//     has no tele/stomp exclusion). telefrags[]/stomps[] entries carry the
//     per-kill bounded value. ByWeapon/Matrix/EWep/TotalDamage still
//     exclude them (KTX wpNONE — demostats weapons[].damage excludes them
//     too).
//
// v55: bounded damage becomes death-value-exact (reconstruction change only).
//   - No field-shape change. The bounded value no longer caps the health
//     share against a drifting per-hit health shadow.
//   - A SURVIVED hit is bounded == raw by identity (no overkill); a KILLING
//     hit's overkill is the end-of-frame death broadcast, so bounded is raw
//     plus the (negative) death value (armor cancels; combat.c:944,983).
//   - Residual approximations remain: same-frame multi-hit deaths cascade
//     one death value across the frame's hits (approximate save split); the
//     -99 corpse-health clamp (combat.c:259) and respawn-masked deaths fall
//     back to the shadow-health cap.
//   - Corpus given/taken reconcile ~2.5× tighter (max |Δ| 16/15 vs 44/44);
//     ewep/team bands unchanged (the victim-item one-frame window).
//
// v56: REST time-unit selection (transport-surface only — no stored change).
//   - Every demo endpoint carrying a MATCH-POSITION timestamp gains an
//     optional `units=ms|s` query param and echoes a top-level `timeUnit`.
//     Defaults are unchanged: each endpoint keeps its current native unit
//     (the pass-throughs frags/damage/shots/chat/airgibs/backpacks/
//     weapon-pickups/items-timeline/overview stay int32 ms; the derived
//     views events/buckets-rows/state-at/stream-slice-envelope/loc-trails/
//     items-summary stay float64 s), so an existing consumer that omits the
//     param sees zero behaviour change beyond the additive `timeUnit` field.
//     `units=s` renders an ms-native endpoint's timestamps as seconds;
//     `units=ms` renders a seconds-native endpoint's as int ms — field NAMES
//     never change. DENSE per-sample payloads always stay ms regardless
//     (aim crosshair `t` / lgRamp `since`, stream-slice embedded entries,
//     columnar buckets startMs/windowMs axis); /aim (no sparse match
//     position) and /demoinfo (KTX units island) are ungoverned. The bare-
//     array bodies (chat/airgibs/backpacks/weapon-pickups) gain a
//     {timeUnit, <list>} envelope so the echo has a home. Stored result.*
//     structs, qw-analyze/WASM output, and the golden corpus are unchanged
//     (this bump only restamps schemaVersion).
const CurrentSchemaVersion = 56

// EffectiveMap resolves which map (hence which BSP / loc corpus) this demo was

// The fallback matters: older recorders (e.g. MVDSV 1.00 with KTX 1.43/1.44,
