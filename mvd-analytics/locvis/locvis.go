// Package locvis is a visibility-aware drop-in replacement for the
// nearest-neighbour loc attribution provided by mvd-analytics/loc.
//
// V1 (the production Euclidean nearest-neighbour in loc.Finder) picks
// the geometrically closest loc-point, with no awareness of intervening
// walls. On certain trajectories — e.g. a player jumping over an open
// area whose far wall happens to be very close to a different loc-point
// — V1 produces brief "wall-bleed" loc visits to a place the player
// never visibly entered. These pollute downstream loc-trails, region-
// control, and loc-graph analytics.
//
// locvis wraps loc.Finder with a per-map BSP and runs the V6 algorithm:
// the nearest loc-point whose containing BSP leaf is in the player's
// PVS row wins; if every loc is PVS-vetoed (or the player is jittered
// into a SOLID leaf and the wiggle can't escape), it falls back to V1's
// nearest. The algorithm is validated on demo 216406 (e1m2): 178 wall-
// bleed spans corrected, zero false positives — see
// experiments/locattr/V2b-V6-HANDOFF.md.
//
// Implementation choice: at LoadForMap we walk every leaf once and
// precompute `leafVisLocs[L]` — the list of loc indices whose containing
// leaf is in L's PVS row. At query time we resolve the player's leaf,
// look up that leaf's pre-filtered candidate list, and linear-scan it
// for Euclidean nearest. That replaces a per-query O(N log N) sort with
// an O(M) scan where M is "locs visible from the player's current leaf"
// — typically 30–80 candidates on competitive maps. Per-leaf list
// construction is one-shot at map load (O(leafCount × N) bit-tests,
// ~300 µs for dm6-class maps). PVS row decompression happens during
// preprocessing only, never on the hot path.
//
// When no BSP is available for the current map (file missing, parse
// error, or the WASM host did not install fetchBspSync), the Finder
// degenerates to the bare loc.Finder — bit-identical V1 behaviour. So
// locvis is always safe to swap in.
//
// The active algorithm is a compile-time constant (ActiveAlgorithm
// below). AlgoV6 is the default; AlgoV1 disables the veto for A/B-ing
// against the baseline at compile time. Earlier iterations also shipped
// a raycast variant (V6a) but it was strictly more expensive and
// produced false positives in the research corpus, so it's been dropped.
