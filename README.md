# MVD Analyzer

A three-layer toolkit for QuakeWorld demo analysis. MVD bytes go in one end,
structured analysis comes out the middle, and browser/CLI/AI consumers pick
up whatever they need from the Result JSON at the far end.

## Architecture

```
  ┌─────────────┐   Event schema   ┌─────────────┐   Result schema   ┌──────────────┐
  │   Source    │ ───────────────▶ │  Analytics  │ ────────────────▶ │   Consumer   │

   MVD file, QTV                    Pipeline of                       Web UI, CLI,
   stream, JSON                     analyzers over                    AI review
   replayer                         event stream                      agent, bulk
                                                                      batch tool
```

The *schemas* — events and results — are the real contracts. Implementations
on either side can come and go as long as the schemas hold.

### Five Go modules in one workspace

The repo is a Go workspace (`go.work`) binding five sibling modules:

| Module | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| [mvd-reader](mvd-reader/README.md)       | `mvd-reader/`       | Event schema + MVD source (Layer 1)               |
| [mvd-analytics](mvd-analytics/README.md) | `mvd-analytics/`    | Analysis pipeline + Result schema + view API (L2) |
| [mvd-api](mvd-api/README.md)             | `mvd-api/`          | HTTP REST server on top of `mvd-analytics/view`   |
| [mvd-mcp](mvd-mcp/README.md)             | `mvd-mcp/`          | MCP shim that talks to mvd-api — stdio (local) or streamable HTTP (hosted) |
| [mvd-web](mvd-web/README.md)             | `mvd-web/`          | Browser UI + WASM glue (Layer 3)                  |

Each module has its own `go.mod`, is tested in isolation, and can be extracted
to its own repo later. Until that's needed, the workspace keeps
cross-layer iteration fast: one git tree, one PR per change.

### Why layered?

Splitting ingestion, analytics, and transport into separate layers lets each
grow on its own timeline. Today's concrete shape:

- **Layer 1 (`mvd-reader`)** is the only place that knows the MVD binary
  format. A future QTV live-stream source would sit beside the MVD source
  and emit the same events — downstream analytics wouldn't change.
- **Layer 2 (`mvd-analytics`)** is the only place that knows how to compute
  match summaries, frag streaks, timeline buckets, or loc-graphs. New
  analytics land here. The `view/` sub-package turns the canonical `Streams`
  into bucketed timelines, event lists, point-in-time state, loc trails, and
  interval segmentations (best-scoring top windows, per-life rollups).
  Analytics never peeks at MVD bytes; it consumes events.
- **Layer 3 consumers** read `Result` or call `view/` and produce something
  user-facing. When hosted, the service presents **four surfaces** — REST,
  MCP over stdio, MCP over HTTP, and the web UI:
  - `mvd-analytics/cmd/qw-analyze` — offline CLI (one demo → JSON / md / events).
  - `mvd-api` — hosted REST API + three-tier on-disk cache (raw bytes, parsed
    Result, lazy artifacts). Optionally API-key-gated with a Discord key portal.
  - `mvd-mcp` — MCP shim that forwards every tool call to a running `mvd-api`.
    Two transports: **stdio** (a small `.exe` for Claude Desktop / Cursor /
    Claude Code) and **streamable HTTP** (`-http`, for hosting with per-request
    API-key auth). See [`deploy/`](deploy/README.md) for the hosted layout.
  - `mvd-web` — browser UI compiled to WASM.

## Quick start

### Dev container

For a reproducible toolchain (pinned Go, `gh`, `jq`, build deps, Claude Code)
without installing anything locally, open the repo in a dev-container-aware
editor — [Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/dev-containers) ("reopen in container"),
VS Code, or the `devcontainer` CLI. It builds from
[`.devcontainer/`](.devcontainer/README.md) with no prebuilt image required;
your git identity and `GH_TOKEN` stay on the host (see that README for the
environment variables to export).

### Analyze a demo at the command line

```bash
go run ./mvd-analytics/cmd/qw-analyze demo.mvd.gz                 # Result JSON to stdout
go run ./mvd-analytics/cmd/qw-analyze -format md demo.mvd.gz      # human summary
go run ./mvd-analytics/cmd/qw-analyze -format events demo.mvd.gz  # line-delimited events
go run ./mvd-analytics/cmd/qw-analyze -view top-kills demo.mvd.gz # one query-API view
```

`-view` runs one view instead of the whole Result, covering the same surface
mvd-api serves: `buckets`, `events`, `stream-slice`, `state-at`, `trails`,
`region-control`, `top-kills`, `top-windows`, `lives`, `items`,
`items-summary`, `airgibs`, `frags`, `damage`, `aim`, `chat`, `backpacks`,
`weapon-pickups`, `player-stats`, `shots`, `loc-graph`, `loc-table`,
`metadata`, `demoinfo`. It also takes a comma-separated list — `-view
top-kills,airgibs` returns both from a single analysis pass, keyed by view
name. See [`mvd-analytics/README.md`](mvd-analytics/README.md) for the
per-view knobs and the two places CLI defaults differ from REST.

### Run the web UI locally

```bash
make serve                                  # http://localhost:8080
```

### Build the WASM bundle for deploy

```bash
make bsps                                   # fetch the curated BSP set for visibility-aware loc attribution
make build                                  # output in dist/
```

`make bsps` populates a gitignored top-level `bsps/` directory with
the competitive QW map set defined in
[`scripts/fetch-bsps.sh`](scripts/fetch-bsps.sh) (id-stock from
[id-maps-gpl](https://github.com/quakeworld/id-maps-gpl), community
maps from [maps.quakeworld.nu/core](https://maps.quakeworld.nu/core/),
sha256-pinned). `make build` then copies them into `dist/bsps/` for
the WASM worker to lazy-fetch per map. The script hard-fails on any
download or sha mismatch so a flaky mirror produces a red build
rather than a silent V1-everywhere deploy.

For local dev the step is skippable — maps without a BSP fall back to
the V1 Euclidean nearest-neighbour attribution (i.e. the pre-v9
behaviour); only the wall-bleed correction is lost.

### Serve the REST API (`mvd-api`)

```bash
make build-api                              # ./dist/mvd-api
./dist/mvd-api -addr :8080                  # HTTP REST on top of mvd-analytics/view
make build-api-linux build-api-darwin build-api-windows
```

`mvd-api` hosts the analytics surface for non-Go consumers
(third-party integrations, the MCP shim, a future web frontend that
benefits from server-side caching). Demos are addressed by hub gameId
or uploaded directly (`POST /v1/demos`, REST-only) and analyzed
identically. See [`mvd-api/README.md`](mvd-api/README.md) for the
endpoint table; the running server also describes itself — an OpenAPI
3.1 spec at `/openapi.yaml`, browsable at `/docs`.

**API stability.** `/v1` is **not frozen yet**. Most change is additive —
new endpoints and response fields appear without announcement — but a schema
upgrade can still withdraw a documented field or change what one means
(v70 removed four fields from `/overview` that were copies of other
endpoints). What is guaranteed today is that nothing changes silently: every
observable change bumps `schemaVersion` and is written up in
[RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) against that version, the served spec is
generated from the running code and validated against real responses, and the
MCP shim deploys in lockstep with the API. So `schemaVersion` is a cache key
*and*, for now, the signal to go read what moved. The intended destination —
additive-only `/v1`, breaks as `/v2/<endpoint>` served *alongside* it, old
routes retiring on a minimum of 8 weeks' notice — is near-term, and stated as
a direction rather than a promise already in force. A correctness fix (a value
that changes because it was computed wrongly) keeps the field's name and type
and at most narrows its documented meaning. In return clients must ignore
unknown fields and enum values. The full policy is
[`mvd-api/API.md` §2.7](mvd-api/API.md#27-api-versioning-and-stability),
also served in the spec's own description at `/docs`.

### Run MCP locally (`mvd-mcp`)

`mvd-mcp` is a thin (~7 MB) stdio MCP server that lets AI clients
(Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, anything that speaks MCP) query
the QuakeWorld demo corpus. It carries no analytics code of its own
— two of its tool calls go straight to hub.quakeworld.nu Supabase
(search), and the rest are forwarded as HTTP requests to a running
`mvd-api`. The split lets you ship a small distributable binary for
end-users without bundling the parser, and keeps the wire contract
owned by `mvd-api`.

```bash
make build-mcp                              # ./dist/mvd-mcp
./dist/mvd-api -addr :8080 &                # local API (or point at a remote one)
./dist/mvd-mcp -api http://localhost:8080   # stdio MCP shim — read from stdin, respond on stdout
make build-mcp-windows                      # dist/mvd-mcp-windows-amd64.exe for Claude Desktop
make build-all-platforms                    # cross-compile both mvd-api and mvd-mcp
```

#### Tool surface

Twenty-six tools — one for discovery, two for cache control + curated
summary, the high-level Result-section pass-throughs (KTX demoinfo,
metadata, player-stats, frags, damage, aim, loc-graph, chat, backpacks,
items, map entities, weapon-pickups, loc-table), eight for the view
query layer,
and two generic
DAG-artifact tools (`listArtifacts` + `getArtifact`) that reach any
servable artifact by name:

| Tool | Backing |
|---|---|
| **Discovery** | |
| `searchGames(players, teams, map, mode, matchtag, from, to, limit, offset)` | hub.quakeworld.nu Supabase (direct) |
| **Cache + summary** | |
| `loadDemo({gameId or sha256})` | `mvd-api` `POST /v1/demos/{id}` |
| `getOverview(demoId)` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/overview` |
| **Result section pass-throughs** | |
| `getDemoInfo(demoId)` | `mvd-api` `/demoinfo` (KTX scoreboard) |
| `getMetadata(demoId)` | `mvd-api` `/metadata` (server cvars + match settings) |
| `getPlayerStats(demoId, players, teams)` | `mvd-api` `/player-stats` (canonical per-player + per-team row) |
| `getFrags(demoId, players, weapon)` | `mvd-api` `/frags` (aggregates + full kill log) |
| `getDamage(demoId, players, weapon)` | `mvd-api` `/damage` (per-hit log + matrix + EWep buckets + scoreboard cross-check) |
| `getAim(demoId, players, …)` | `mvd-api` `/aim` (crosshair error, LG ramp, rocket direct/splash) |
| `getLocGraph(demoId)` | `mvd-api` `/loc-graph` (per-map loc adjacency) |
| `getChat(demoId, players, from, to, types)` | `mvd-api` `/chat` |
| `getBackpacks(demoId, players, weapon)` | `mvd-api` `/backpacks` |
| `getItems(demoId, items, players, kinds)` | `mvd-api` `/items` |
| `getMapEntitiesByMap(map, types, kinds)` | `mvd-api` `/v1/maps/{map}/entities` (static map layout) |
| `getWeaponPickups(demoId, players, weapon, source)` | `mvd-api` `/weapon-pickups` |
| `getLocTable(demoId)` | `mvd-api` `/loc-table` (decoder for `loc=index`) |
| **View queries** | |
| `getBuckets(demoId, windowMs, fields, reducers, layout, …)` | `mvd-api` `/buckets` (default column-major; `layout=row` for the per-bucket shape) |
| `getEvents(demoId, types, …)` | `mvd-api` `/events` |
| `getStreamSlice(demoId, from, to, fields, …)` | `mvd-api` `/stream-slice` |
| `getStateAt(demoId, time, fields, …)` | `mvd-api` `/state-at` |
| `getLocTrails(demoId, minDwellMs, …)` | `mvd-api` `/loc-trails` |
| `getRegionControl(demoId, windowMs, regions, …)` | `mvd-api` `/region-control` |
| `getTopWindows(demoId, metric, mode, windowMs, gapMs, limit, perPlayer, …)` | `mvd-api` `/top-windows` (each player's best stretches, ranked — fixed-length windows or gap-delimited runs) |
| `getTopKills(demoId, gapMs, weapons, minDamage, …)` | `mvd-api` `/top-kills` (the hardest kill bursts, ranked) |
| `getLives(demoId, players, minMs, …)` | `mvd-api` `/lives` (one row per spawn-to-death life) |
| **Generic DAG artifacts** | |
| `listArtifacts()` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/artifacts` (the DAG manifest) |
| `getArtifact(demoId, name)` | `mvd-api` `GET /v1/demos/{id}/artifacts/{name}` (any servable artifact by name) |

**Full schemas live in three places:**

- **[`mvd-mcp/README.md`](mvd-mcp/README.md)** — per-tool *input* schemas
  (parameters, types, defaults). What the MCP SDK exposes via
  `tools/list`.
- **[`mvd-api/README.md`](mvd-api/README.md)** — REST endpoint
  responses, including the `Overview` shape that's unique to the API
  layer.
- **[`mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md`](mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md)**
  — view types (`BucketsView` / `ColumnarBuckets`, `EventsView`,
  `StreamSliceView`, `StateAtView`, `LocTrailsView`,
  `RegionControlResult`, `TopWindowsView`, `LivesView`,
  `TopKillsView`), the
  field-code vocabulary, the reducer registry, and the underlying
  `Result` / `Streams` types. View outputs are the same whether
  reached via WASM, the CLI, or MCP. The view layer is the
  parameterised-query seam — any function that takes a time / window
  knob lives there; static analyzer derivations
  (`FragResult`, `LocGraphResult`, `MetadataResult`, …) are served
  directly from result fields by the REST/MCP layer.

Tool errors come back as MCP `isError: true` results with the upstream
error message in `TextContent`. The model can read them and recover
(e.g. call `loadDemo` first when a per-demo tool says `demo_not_found`).

#### Typical session shape

```
1. searchGames({player: "bps", map: "dm6"})
     → list of recent matches with rosters, scores, dates.
       Direct hit on the hub; no mvd-api round-trip.

2. loadDemo({gameId: 12345})
     → mvd-api fetches MVD bytes, parses, caches.
       Slow only on cold demos (2–10 s); warm cache is sub-millisecond.

3. getOverview({demoId: "sha:..."}) | getBuckets | getStateAt | ...
     → analytics for the chosen demo. Fast on warm cache.
```

If the answer is already in a search-result row (e.g. "what was the
score?", "who played?"), the agent should stop there — no
`loadDemo` needed.

```

- **`searchGames`** goes directly to the hub. Discovery is the hub's
  job — `mvd-api` is narrowly responsible for "given a known
  `demoId`: fetch bytes, parse, cache, serve view analytics."
- **`loadDemo` / `get*`** go through `mvd-api`, which talks to the
  hub only to download `.mvd.gz` bytes (the rest comes from its
  three-tier on-disk cache: raw bytes, parsed Result, lazy artifacts).
- `mvd-web` (the browser UI) uses the same Supabase search path
  directly — both consumers behave identically against the hub.

#### Authentication

There is none, by design. The QW demo corpus is public, the API is
read-only, and the Supabase anon key is the same one shipped in the
web bundle. The optional `-label TAG` flag (or `Authorization: Bearer
<label>` on `mvd-api`) is **not** validated — it's a non-secret
request-source tag captured in `mvd-api`'s access log for analytics.
Common labels: `mcp-claude-desktop`, `claude-code-local`,
`web-community`.

If real auth ever becomes necessary (abuse / rate-limit enforcement),
the surface is small enough to add bearer-token validation in
`mvd-api`'s middleware without changes to the MCP shim.

#### Client setup

The shortest path for each major MCP client:

**Claude Code** — drop a `.mcp.json` in the repo root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mvd-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/mvd-mcp",
      "args": ["-api", "http://localhost:8080", "-label", "claude-code-local"]
    }
  }
}
```

Auto-approve tool calls (skip the permission prompt each time) via
`.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{ "permissions": { "allow": ["mcp__mvd-mcp__*"] } }
```

**Claude Desktop** — edit `claude_desktop_config.json`
(`%APPDATA%\Claude\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`
on macOS, `~/.config/Claude/` on Linux):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mvd-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\Tools\\mvd-mcp.exe",
      "args": ["-api", "https://mvd-api.example.com", "-label", "mcp-claude-desktop"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client after editing. See
[`mvd-mcp/CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md`](mvd-mcp/CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md) for the full
matrix (proxy vs local-API, Windows SmartScreen / macOS Gatekeeper
notes, Cursor setup).

#### Distribution

Cross-compile produces unsigned binaries:

```bash
make build-all-platforms
# dist/mvd-mcp-linux-amd64
# dist/mvd-mcp-darwin-amd64
# dist/mvd-mcp-darwin-arm64
# dist/mvd-mcp-windows-amd64.exe
```

For end-users, distribute the platform-matching `mvd-mcp-*` binary
and the client config snippet. They don't need `mvd-api` locally if
you operate one publicly; otherwise the shim runs against a local
`mvd-api` on `localhost:8080`.

Windows SmartScreen / macOS Gatekeeper will warn on first run
(unsigned binaries). Documented workarounds in
[`mvd-mcp/CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md`](mvd-mcp/CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md); real
code-signing is a planned follow-up.

See [`mvd-mcp/README.md`](mvd-mcp/README.md) for the per-tool input
schemas and the rationale behind keeping the shim small.

Other Makefile targets: `make test`, `make fmt`, `make clean`, `make help`.

## The contracts

### Event schema (Layer 1 → 2)

Defined in [`mvd-reader/events`](mvd-reader/events/events.go). A `Source` is a
pull-style iterator:

```go
type Source interface {
    Next() (Event, error)   // returns io.EOF at clean end
    Close() error
}
```

Concrete event types are plain structs: `ServerDataEvent`, `UserInfoEvent`,
`PrintEvent` (one complete console *line*, reassembled from however many
`svc_print` fragments the server split it into — old kmod/qwe emits an
obituary as three), `StatUpdateEvent`, `FragUpdateEvent`, `PlayerPositionEvent`,
`DamageEvent`, `DemoInfoEvent`, `IntermissionEvent`, `StuffTextEvent`,
`CenterPrintEvent`, `ServerInfoEvent`, `DeathEvent`, `SpawnEvent`,
`ItemSpawnEvent`, `ItemStateEvent`, `ItemMoveEvent`, `BackpackDropHintEvent`,
`ItemPickupHintEvent`, `BackpackPickupHintEvent`,
`BackpackExpireHintEvent` (KTX `//ktx expire` — an RL/LG pack removed
untaken at the 120 s timeout, the only wire statement that a pack was
*not* picked up),
`ItemPickupPrintEvent`,
`PlayerDepartureEvent` / `PlayerRejoinEvent` (the KTX/kmod roster
broadcasts — "left the game with N frags", "rejoins the game with N
frags", "reenters the game without stats"; decoded once in the parser
because the wire fragments them at arbitrary points, including inside
the number),
`DemoMarkEvent` (KTX `//demomark` player-inserted bookmark — slot + label),
`FinalScoresEvent` (KTX `//finalscores` end-of-match scoreline — the
server's own mode, map and final result, on 64% of the archive against
the demoinfo block's 46%),
`DemoStartTimestampEvent` (mvdhidden `0x000B` wall-clock anchor),
`PausedDurationEvent` (mvdhidden `0x000A` per-frame pause duration),
`SoundEvent` (`svc_sound` — emitting entity + channel + resolved sound
path; weapon-fire sounds drive the shots analyzer),
`ProjectileSpawnEvent` / `ProjectileDespawnEvent` (rocket/grenade entity
flight brackets — the shots analyzer links RL/GL fires to their impacts),
`BeamEvent` (`svc_temp_entity` lightning beams — `TE_LIGHTNING2` is the
per-tick LG fire signal),
`PointEffectEvent` (`svc_temp_entity` point effects — TE_BLOOD /
TE_LIGHTNINGBLOOD per-hit damage telemetry, TE_EXPLOSION detonation
points, TE_GUNSHOT miss puffs, plus the rest of the TE vocabulary),
`NailsFrameEvent` (`svc_nails` spike snapshots — opt-in, off by default),
`MoverSpawnEvent` / `MoverStateEvent` (inline brush-model entities —
lifts, doors, trains — identity plus per-frame origin while moving).
Domain types carried by events — `ServerData`, `PlayerInfo` — are
source-agnostic.

`DeathEvent` / `SpawnEvent` are derived events the parser synthesises
from `StatHealth` edges so analytics never has to reconstruct
death/spawn by comparing samples across the sampling boundary.
`ItemSpawnEvent` / `ItemStateEvent` / `ItemMoveEvent` are derived from the
entity-state stream (`svc_spawnbaseline` + `svc_packetentities` /
`svc_deltapacketentities`): every item's identity, its
pickup/respawn transitions (each carrying the entity's origin) and, for the
one item class that moves — a dropped backpack, tossed with
`MOVETYPE_TOSS` — its fall to wherever it landed, come out of the wire
directly, with no KTX prints and no BSP preprocessing. `ItemPickupHintEvent` /
`BackpackPickupHintEvent` / `BackpackDropHintEvent` /
`BackpackExpireHintEvent` carry KTX's authoritative `//ktx took`,
`//ktx bp`, `//ktx drop`, `//ktx expire` directives — the touch-level
pickup attribution that entity-state alone can only approximate, plus the
one directive that states a pack was never taken. They only fire on KTX servers; non-KTX sources get
entity-state and stats deltas. `ItemPickupPrintEvent` parses the
per-client "You got the X" / "You receive N health" prints that
target the picking player via `dem_single`; it fills the gap where
`//ktx took` is silent (ammo boxes, H15/H25) but only survives to
the MVD for players who set `msg 0` in their client config (see
`mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md` for the server-side `messagelevel` filter
that strips PRINT_LOW in most competitive demos). KTX's `"You get "`
backpack opener is not decoded into a typed event — see MVD_FORMAT.md.

To write a new source: implement `events.Source`, emit the concrete event
types as you decode your wire format. That's it. See
[`mvd-reader/source/mvd`](mvd-reader/source/mvd/source.go) for the reference
implementation backed by MVD files.

### Result schema (Layer 2 → 3)

Defined in [`mvd-analytics/result`](mvd-analytics/result/result.go). `Result` is
a JSON-serializable struct with sub-results from every analyzer that ran:
match, frags, messages, demoinfo, timeline analysis, metadata, locgraph,
items (per-item pickup / respawn timeline — works on any MVD source),
damage (per-hit damage log + aggregates — attacker→victim matrix,
per-weapon, given/taken, and the EWep victim-weapon buckets — from the
KTX `mvdhidden_dmgdone` stream with a scoreboard cross-check, or
reconstructed from the state streams on pre-instrumentation demos;
`damage.source` = `ktx` | `reconstructed` tells which),
shots (per-shot weapon-fire stream — who fired what at exactly what ms,
from `svc_sound` fire sounds + LG `TE_LIGHTNING2` beams — with same-frame hitscan→damage
links, entity-tracked rocket/grenade→impact links, per-victim
enemy/team/self classification, and a KTX-accuracy cross-check),
aim (per-player aim analysis derived from shots + streams + damage —
normalized crosshair-error samples for hitscan, LG ramp-onto-target, rocket
direct/splash, LG reach/whiff, and enemy/team/self hit-counter slices;
exact target attribution in duels, a labeled nearest-crosshair heuristic
in team games; `aim.hitsSource` names the damage evidence, and on a
reconstructed section the hit counts appear only in the separate
`weapons[].recon` tier),
backpacks (RL/LG drops attributed to the dropping player, each row
stamped `source`: `ktx` from the `//ktx drop` hint, or `reconstructed`
where the mod predates that hint — a replay of KTX's own `DropBackpack`
rule from the death instant, the wielded-weapon stat and the death
position, validated at 99.97% precision/recall against the hints; a
reconstructed row also carries the pack's `fate` — `picked` with the
`picker` named, `expired` at KTX's 120 s removal timeout, or
`unobserved` — read off the wire's backpack-entity track, 100% precision
and 96.1% recall against the `//ktx bp` hints and 100%/100% on `expired`
against `//ktx expire`, which a `ktx` row carries as its own `fate`),
weaponPickups (every slot-weapon acquisition —
world spawners and RL/LG backpacks — with a kills-before-next-death
effectiveness metric; joins to backpacks via `backpackEnt` ==
`backpacks[].entNum`), opening (schema v51 — each player's
match-start spawn loc plus the first take of every contested spawner,
the one-fetch answer to opening-race questions), and playerStats
(schema v63 — the canonical per-player and per-team statistics row:
corrected scoreboard, damage, pickup tallies and **possession time**
(time with each weapon, each armor type, and with **no armor**), each
family tagged with whether it came from KTX or was derived here.
Computed for every demo, including ones with no KTX demoinfo block at
all; `demoInfo` stays the verbatim KTX pass-through it is diffable
against). Schema v7 introduced `streams` as the canonical
event-rate storage — every per-player field (vitals, weapons, ammo,
position) recorded at the rate it actually changed. Schema v8 stores
**every timestamped field** as `int32` milliseconds rather than float
seconds — the MVD wire format delivers ms deltas, and keeping the
unit integer end-to-end eliminates the float-precision drift that
previously broke spawn/death-boundary comparisons in locgraph and
keeps the schema consistent and sensible to extend. As of schema v57
(the pure-ms model) the view-layer query API (`view.Buckets`,
`view.Events`, `view.StreamSlice`, `view.StateAt`) also takes and emits
**int32 milliseconds** at its public surface — no seconds anywhere,
inputs or outputs, so REST/MCP `from`/`to`/`time` params and every
response time field are int32 ms alike. Schema v65 adds two **interval
segmentations** to that same view layer:
`top-windows` (each player's best fixed-length stretches, ranked by a
caller-chosen summable metric) and `lives` (one row per spawn-to-death
run, cut at the v64 `streams.players[].alive` boundaries). They share one
per-interval stats block and one envelope `measured` marker — every
numeric stat is emitted including a measured zero, so measuredness is
read from that marker and never from a field's absence — and a player's
lives partition the match, so unfiltered per-life sums reconcile exactly
with `frags.frags[]` on the frag side and with `/damage`'s non-summary
aggregate on the damage side — not necessarily with the `byPlayer`
scoreboards, which count deaths no log row recorded. Schema v67 adds the
third cut of the same primitive, `top-kills`: the match's hardest kill
**bursts**, each the run of killing-weapon hits that produced one kill,
ranked by burst damage. It is the one that is not an interval reduction and
so carries no stats block — its `gapMs` is a CAPTURE gap narrowed
client-side by each row's `maxGapMs`, positional kills produce no row, and
kills by an already-dead killer stay in. `Result` itself gains exactly one field in v65,
`frags.killsMeasured`: the demo-global verdict on whether kill
attribution was observable at all, which the `measured` marker's `frags`
flag republishes rather than re-deriving. Schema v9 adds visibility-aware loc
attribution: when a per-map BSP is available, the analyzer rejects
candidate loc-points that fall outside the player's potentially-
visible-set (PVS), eliminating brief "wall-bleed" phantom loc visits
the V1 pure-Euclidean nearest-neighbour produced (see
[mvd-analytics/locvis](mvd-analytics/locvis/) and
[experiments/locattr/V2b-V6-HANDOFF.md](experiments/locattr/V2b-V6-HANDOFF.md)
for the empirical evidence). Field shapes are unchanged — only the
contents of `PlayerStream.Loc` (and everything derived: LocTrails,
LocGraph edges, RegionControl) shift for maps with BSPs. Schema v10
makes the `DF_DEAD` bit in `svc_playerinfo` the primary
DeathEvent / SpawnEvent signal, with the existing `STAT_HEALTH`
detector dedupling against it as a safety net — deaths whose
`dem_stats` block was directed at a different player slot are no
longer dropped (PlayerStream.Spawns / Deaths counts rise; LocGraph
edges, LocTrails durations, RegionControl ticks, and WeaponPickups
windows shift across the now-present boundaries). Schema v11 makes the
50 ms bucket view column-major (`view.ColumnarBuckets`) the default
across web / REST / MCP. Schema v12 adds optional `armed`,
`unarmed`, `quad` and `pent` weights to each `LocGraph` node (time) *and*
edge (transition counts) — the same breakdown restricted to samples where
the player held RL/LG, held neither, or had an active quad / pent — so
consumers can render a self-contained loc graph / heatmap per combat
posture. Schema v13 adds the `mapEntities` section — the map's static
designed layout (item spawns, player spawnpoints, teleport
sources/destinations, buttons) from the offline-generated mapents corpus
— which v14 extends with brush entities (teleport/button/door volumes
with bounds) plus the teleport source→destination link. Schema v15 adds
`timelineAnalysis.deathEvents`: a per-player death stream (`{time, player,
team}`) parallel to `fragEvents`, sourced from the authoritative protocol
DeathEvent (every death counts once), so the Timeline tab can draw
per-player frags-up / deaths-down charts and KTX-style efficiency
(`frags / (frags + deaths)`). Schema v16 adds `frags.byPlayer[].teamkills`
(KTX "tk") and recovers teamkills whose obituary names only one party, so
they re-enter `frags.frags` as complete killer↔victim pairs: killer-named
("X loses another friend") fill in the victim from the coincident
`DeathEvent`; victim-named ("X was telefragged by his teammate") fill in
the killer by combining position co-location with the teamkiller's −1
frag-delta. Across the test corpus this brings per-player teamkills to an
exact match with KTX's authoritative `tk`. Schema v18 adds
`timelineAnalysis.killEvents`: a per-player enemy-kill stream (`{time,
player, team}`) keyed on the killer, parallel to `deathEvents` and sourced
from the canonical frag log (suicides/teamkills excluded), so the Timeline
tab's per-player drill-down plots an exact cumulative kills − deaths +/-
that reconciles with `frags.byPlayer[].kills` and the kills-based
efficiency. (Team is best-effort and ungated, unlike `deathEvents`, so a
player's curve survives POV demos with an incomplete name↔team join — the
consumer groups by player name.)

Schema v19 adds `match.players[].kills`, `.deaths` and `.suicides` — the
frag-log-corrected counts, independent of the sometimes-wrong KTX demoinfo
stats. KTX credits several self / positional deaths to the wrong entity:
pentagram-deflect telefrags inflate the deflector's kills, and world-dealt
suicides (fall / lava / squish / drown) bump the world entity's counter
instead of the victim's, so demoinfo undercounts suicides. This makes
`match.players` a complete corrected scoreboard, and the API `/overview`
surfaces the same counts so non-web consumers get the correction the web
Summary already applied.

Schema v20 adds the `damage` section: per-hit damage reconstructed from the
KTX `mvdhidden_dmgdone` stream, with an attacker→victim `matrix`, per-weapon
and per-player given/taken totals, the **EWep** victim-weapon buckets
(`enemyVsSg/Mid/Lg/Rl/Both`, where `ewep = lg + rl + both`), and a
`scoreboard` cross-check against the KTX end-of-match totals. Since schema
v54 damage ships in **two families**: the **raw** wire value (the full hit
including overkill, capped only at 9999) and a **bounded** reconstruction of
KTX's scoreboard `dmg_dealt` (armor absorbed + health capped to the victim's
remaining health) carried in additive `bounded` fields. Positional kills
(telefrags, stomps) are surfaced separately and kept out of `events` /
every per-weapon map / `matrix` / `ewep`, but their damage now folds into
`given`/`givenTeam`/`taken` in both families (matching KTX's own
accumulation). The REST `/damage` `dmg=raw|bounded|both` param picks the
family. Schema v63 adds `byWeaponTeam` / `byWeaponSelf` beside `byWeapon`
in both families (and in `playerStats.damage`): the same attacker-weapon
split for team and self damage, with the KTX overlays sourcing the team
map from `weapons[].damage.team`. Schema v69 adds the other axis to
`playerStats`: `score.byEnemyWeapon` and `damage.byEnemyWeapon` split the
same kills and the same enemy damage by what the **victim** was holding,
in exclusive buckets (`both` / `rl` / `lg` / `mid` / `sg`) that partition
`kills` and `given` — so "enemies killed while holding an RL" is
`rl + both`, never `rl` alone. Both are derived from the victim's
possession streams rather than overlaid: KTX's own `ekills` counts the
kill side inclusively and force-zeroes whole buckets by mode, and on the
damage side the server keeps only the RL+LG-lumped `enemyWeapons` scalar.
Schema v71 makes the section available on **every** demo: where the wire
never carried the damage stream (~45% of the archive), the `damage-recon`
node reconstructs it from the h/a change streams + beams / projectiles /
fire sounds / position tracks / the frag log, at ~1% median per-player
total error against KTX ground truth; `damage.source`
(`ktx`&nbsp;|&nbsp;`reconstructed`) says which kind a consumer is holding
(see [`mvd-analytics/damagerecon/ACCURACY.md`](mvd-analytics/damagerecon/ACCURACY.md)).

`streams.global` carries a wall-clock anchor so a consumer can project any
match-relative game time onto real-world time (for syncing voice tracks /
stream overlays): `demoStartUnixMs` (server clock, Unix epoch ms, at demo
open), `demoStartAccuracyMs` (its resolution — `1` from the millisecond
mvdhidden `0x000B` block, `1000` from the whole-second serverinfo `epoch`
cvar), `demoOffset` (demo-open → match-start), and `pauses[]`
(`{ atMs, durationMs }` per pause). The game clock freezes during a pause
while wall-clock time runs on, so pauses must be folded in:

```
wallClockMs = demoStartUnixMs + demoOffset + gameMs + Σ durationMs (atMs ≤ gameMs)
```

The pause durations come from the mvdhidden `0x000A` `paused_duration` blocks
mvdsv embeds once per paused idle frame (the parser handles their
non-standard, length-header-less framing; QW-Group/mvdsv PR #210 adds the
canonical framing, also supported). Anchor fields are omitted when the demo
carries no wall-clock source; implausible `0x000B` payloads fall back to
`epoch`. (Introduced in v21–v22 on `timelineAnalysis`; **moved to
`streams.global` and exposed via the REST `/overview` `timing` block in
v23**, alongside `matchStart`/`matchEnd`.)

Both of those sources are modern-mvdsv features, present on ~25% of the
archive. Schema **v72** adds a second anchor beside them — `matchStartUnixMs`,
the wall clock at *match* start — read from the date markers the wire has
always carried: KTX's `matchdate:` broadcast print (ISO or ctime layout), the
kmod-era `matchkey:` print, and the ktxstats `date` string (which names match
*end*, also published as `matchEndUnixMs`). That reaches ~95% of the archive.
Timezones are resolved from the printed token where there is one, and a stamp
without one is read as UTC with `matchStartAccuracyMs` saying so
(50 400 000). Because old servers ran with unset clocks, each anchor is graded
`matchStartConfidence` = `exact` / `unverified` / `contradicted` — on
CONTRADICTION only (a stamp predating the `*version` / `ktxver` binary's
release), never on the date value — with `matchStartNote` naming the failed
check and `dateMarkers[]` listing every stamp seen. Nothing is dropped. Where
the demo has no server-clock source, `demoStartUnixMs` is back-shifted from an
uncontradicted marker by `demoOffset` so the formula above keeps working, and
`demoStartSource` records which source it came from.

Schema v24–v28 enrich the position track with map-geometry-derived
per-sample columns: height above the floor (`h`, v24 — traced through the
map's BSP clip hull, later refined to a bounding-box footprint in v26 and
to stand players on moving brush models in v27) and liquid state (`lq`,
v28 — dry / water / slime / lava plus submersion level). v25 adds
`timelineAnalysis.airgibs` — direct airborne rocket hits surfaced for Key
Moments — and v29–v30 refine its ranking and uncap the list. Schema v58
adds `timelineAnalysis.demoMarkers` — the bookmarks players insert in-game
with KTX `/demomark`, attributed to the marking player's slot with an
optional label and a negative `time` for a warmup mark — and a matching
`demomark` type in the `/events` default set. The `/events` default set
also carries `airgib` (from `timelineAnalysis.airgibs`) and `pause`
(from `streams.global.pauses`, playerless, `detail.durationMs`) — a
view-layer addition (no schema bump) that puts both on the MCP surface.
v31 adds the
player's view direction (`vp` / `vya`, raw `angle16` pitch/yaw) and splits
the opt-in view-layer field codes (`view` / `hgt` / `lq`); v32 adds derived
velocity (`vx` / `vy` / `vz`, units/sec) behind the `vel` code. v33 stores
position, velocity and height as `float32` (no longer truncated to whole
units); v34 collapses `locationData` to one anchor point (the medoid) per
loc name; v35 adds `streams.movers[]` — the pose timeline of every tracked
brush-model entity (lift, door, plat, train) — so renderers can animate map
geometry. These additive columns are all `omitempty` and BSP-gated where
noted. Schema v36 is a breaking removal: `match.startTime` / `match.endTime`
drop out (they duplicated `streams.global.matchStart` / `matchEnd` —
`startTime` was always 0 and `endTime` always equalled `duration`).
Schema v37–v38 add two per-opponent visibility tracks to `PlayerStream`,
both computed lazily and BSP-gated (absent from the default parse and on
maps without a provisioned BSP, so additive for existing consumers):
`LOS` (v37) — geometric **line of sight**, the intervals a player has a
clear ray to an opponent (eye point, nine rays against the BSP clip hull
and moving movers, bbox corners; directional, so asymmetric sightlines
survive) — and `PVS` (v38) — server-reproduced **potential visibility**,
wire-exact against mvdsv's `SV_PlayerVisibleToClient`. PVS ⊇ LOS by
construction; the PVS-minus-LOS gap is an occlusion-tolerant
proximity/awareness signal. Both are surfaced through the REST/MCP
`/los` endpoint, the CLI, and the web map overlay.

Two fields report that a result is degraded, and they are deliberately
separate. `errors[]` carries ANALYZER-level failures over events that
decoded fine (a `Finalize` returned an error, the event stream aborted
mid-demo). `parseWarnings` (schema v72) carries the layer below — the
reader's own census of bytes it could not decode at all: unknown `svc_*`
commands, unknown temp-entity or hidden-message types, payloads that
failed to parse, with exact totals, per-category counts and a capped
sample table of distinct messages. It is collected on **every** run
(previously only in the diagnostic test harness, which is how the
`sv_bigcoords` desync degraded ~5% of the archive unnoticed) and omitted
entirely on a clean parse. `qw-analyze` prints a one-line summary to
stderr when a demo raises any, and `-warn` prints the whole table.

`CurrentSchemaVersion` (`mvd-analytics/result/result.go`) is bumped on every
observable change to the analysis output — additive ones included, and
largely view-only ones such as v65, whose two interval segmentations add
no `Result` field at all — so it is first a regeneration counter and cache
key. It is **not only** that while the surface is still settling: a bump can
also carry a removal or a reshape (v70 dropped four `/overview` fields), so
read the version's entry in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) rather than
assuming a bump was additive. Consumers can pin or feature-detect by reading
`result.schemaVersion`. The full per-field
reference and the complete version-history table live in
[mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md](mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md); the
HTTP-level compatibility policy is [`mvd-api/API.md`
§2.7](mvd-api/API.md#27-api-versioning-and-stability).

### Running the pipeline

```go
import (
    "github.com/mvd-analyzer/mvd-analytics/analyzer"
    mvdsource "github.com/mvd-analyzer/mvd-reader/source/mvd"
)

src, err := mvdsource.Open("demo.mvd.gz")
if err != nil { ... }
defer src.Close()

reg := analyzer.NewDefaultRegistry()
res, err := reg.AnalyzeSource(src, "demo.mvd.gz")
// res is *result.Result; marshal to JSON, inspect, etc.
```

Swap the source and the rest keeps working:

```go
src := myQTVClient.Open(...)       // implements events.Source
res, err := reg.AnalyzeSource(src, "live")
```

make test                                               # all modules
go test ./mvd-analytics/analyzer/                         # single package

go test ./mvd-analytics/corpus/                           # special-cases invariants
```

### Special-cases invariants

`mvd-analytics/corpus/` walks `demo-test-data/mvd/special-cases/` — the
per-machine drop of demos that exercise the degradation paths the golden
corpus does not (a player who times out, a connection the server refuses,
an FFA game where nobody has a team, a POV recording) — and asserts
invariants rather than pinning bytes: team frag totals reconcile with the
serverinfo `score` key and with the KTX demoinfo scoreboard, every roster
row has a matching player stream, and item-possession intervals only exist
for a player the wire actually saw play. It skips when the directory is
absent.

### Golden corpus

`make test` runs `TestGoldenCorpus` (in `mvd-analytics/analyzer/golden_test.go`)
against a manifest of hub.quakeworld.nu game IDs in
[`mvd-analytics/testdata/corpus.json`](mvd-analytics/testdata/corpus.json).
On first run it downloads each demo into
`mvd-analytics/testdata/cache/<gameId>.mvd.gz` (gitignored); subsequent runs
hit the cache and stay offline. Each demo's `Result` JSON is pinned
against `mvd-analytics/testdata/golden/<label>.json`.

What is pinned: everything except `filePath`. At schema v7 the
canonical event-rate storage is `streams` (per-player change streams +
intervals + native position track) — bucketed views are produced on
demand by `mvd-analytics/view.Buckets` and not stored. Per-player time
series in `streams.players[]` are sliced to three 15 s windows
(`[0, 15]`, `[60, 75]`, last 15 s) before comparison — the native
position track alone would otherwise run ~10 MB per 4on4 demo and
swamp the git history (see [`golden_test.go`](mvd-analytics/analyzer/golden_test.go)
`sampleStreams`). On top of that, the dense per-sample position/view
track (`streams.players[].pos`) is pinned on only two demos — a full
4on4 and a duel — and dropped from the rest (`dropPositionTracks`),
since that pipeline is map-independent; this keeps the committed corpus
~13 MB total instead of ~34 MB while still verifying every aggregate on
all demos. The golden output also depends on the curated BSP set
(`make bsps`): a demo whose BSP is missing is skipped in compare mode
and hard-fails `-update-golden`, so a degraded run can't clobber a good
golden. Bucketed-view behavior is exercised through the unit tests in
`mvd-analytics/view/equivalence_test.go`.

The manifest ships with ten demos (three 1on1, three 2on2, four 4on4).
Add entries by appending to the JSON array; labels follow
`mode_team1_team2_DDMMYY_map` (or player names for 1on1, where
`team_names` is null on the hub).

Workflow when an analyzer change shifts output:

```bash
make test
# TestGoldenCorpus fails with first-diff-line per demo.
# Inspect the change, then if it was intended:
go test ./mvd-analytics/analyzer/... -run TestGoldenCorpus -args -update-golden
git diff mvd-analytics/testdata/golden/   # review
git add mvd-analytics/testdata/golden/    # commit alongside the analyzer change
```

(The `-update-golden` flag is registered only in the analyzer test
package; wider scopes like `./mvd-analytics/...` fail in `mapgen` with
"flag provided but not defined".)

The pipeline also has a CLI for ad-hoc bulk diffs:

```bash
go run ./mvd-analytics/cmd/qw-analyze -bulk -out-dir /tmp/before -format json demos/
# ... change ...
go run ./mvd-analytics/cmd/qw-analyze -bulk -out-dir /tmp/after  -format json demos/
diff -r /tmp/before /tmp/after
```

## Known limitations

0. **Reconstructed damage is an estimate.** On pre-instrumentation demos
   (no KTX `mvdhidden_dmgdone` stream) the damage section is rebuilt from
   the state streams by the `damage-recon` node and stamped
   `source: "reconstructed"`. Magnitudes are near-exact (the health/armor
   delta IS the bounded value) but attribution is inference: per-player
   match totals run ~1% median error against ground truth, individual
   hits can be misattributed, and team/self splits are indicative only.
   That holds across every server generation: pre-MVDSV-0.30 recordings
   carry far sparser hit telemetry but were measured, on 15 254 demos
   against the obituary with the frag log withheld from attribution, to
   attribute at or above the instrumented eras. What those recordings do
   cost is elsewhere — on 2.1% of qwsv demos the health stat channel is
   barely broadcast, so the section reports only the fraction of the
   match the wire showed, and nothing yet says so. Full accuracy
   tables and trust guidance:
   [`mvd-analytics/damagerecon/ACCURACY.md`](mvd-analytics/damagerecon/ACCURACY.md);
   the feature's design/validation history lives in
   [`plan-damage-recon.md`](plan-damage-recon.md), and the follow-up
   backlog distilled from the archive survey in
   [`plan-archive-features.md`](plan-archive-features.md).

0b. **Reconstructed backpack drops are a replay, not a measurement.** On
   demos older than the KTX `//ktx drop` hint (KTX 1.38 — 51% of the
   archive) the `backpack-recon` node fills the same `backpacks` section
   by replaying `DropBackpack`'s own rule over the recorded
   wielded-weapon stat, stamped `source: "reconstructed"`. Validated at
   99.97% precision and recall against the hints on 316 archive demos, so
   it is far stronger than the damage reconstruction. Its PICKUP side is
   read off the wire's backpack-entity track by the `backpack-linkage`
   node and published on the same row (`fate` / `picker` / `pickerTeam` /
   `pickupTime`, schema v72): 100% precision and 96.1% recall on
   picked-vs-not, 99.98% correct pickers, measured against the `//ktx bp`
   hints on 223 demos, and 100% precision and recall on `expired` against
   KTX's third backpack directive `//ktx expire` — which a hint-carrying
   row publishes as its own `fate`, the only wire statement that a pack
   was NOT taken. What stays out of reach: a pack taken inside the
   demo frame it dropped in never reaches the wire at all (2% of drops,
   the largest residual); pack TRANSFER credit and kill credit still need
   the hint, because `hadBefore` is not derivable; and the server-side
   `dp 0` (drops disabled) setting is published nowhere on the wire, so it
   cannot be ruled out on a pre-1.38 demo. Where the
   evidence is unmeasurable — frozen weapon state, no frag log, a
   fairpacks/yawnmode/bloodfest ruleset — the section is left absent
   rather than half-filled. Accuracy tables and stand-down conditions:
   [`mvd-analytics/analyzer/BACKPACKS.md`](mvd-analytics/analyzer/BACKPACKS.md).

1. **Weapon switching scripts**: QW players use scripts that switch weapons
   faster than MVD stat updates, so any *ammo-delta*-based inference of
   RL/GL usage undercounts. The `shots` analyzer sidesteps this by keying on
   the `svc_sound` weapon-fire sound (which carries the firing entity), not
   ammo — its per-weapon counts match KTX `acc.attacks` exactly across the
   corpus, including RL/GL. The one weapon still counted from ammo is LG
   (it has no per-shot fire sound), which can slip by a single cell at a
   death/discharge boundary. KTX demoinfo stats (when available) remain the
   authoritative reference, and `shots.reconciliation` cross-checks against
   them.

2. **Auth name override**: When players authenticate via mvdsv,
   `sv_forcenick` can set the userinfo name to the login. The analyzer
   resolves display names from KTX demoinfo via `*auth` login join.

3. **Reconnecting players**: When a player disconnects and reconnects
   mid-match they land on a new wire slot (and userid), and their old
   slot is often reused. The `identity` analyzer folds the occupancies
   back into one player — via the KTX `rejoins`/`reenters` prints, then a
   per-session demoinfo login/name join — so pickups, frags, timeline and
   the merged per-player stream stay attributed correctly (matching KTX's
   own ghost-by-netname behaviour). Residual gap: a reconnect on a
   non-KTX demo with no demoinfo *and* a different name each time has no
   signal to link the two names and will not unify. See
   [mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md](mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md) (search "reconnect")
   and [mvd-analytics/analyzer/identity.md](mvd-analytics/analyzer/identity.md).

   The mirror case is a player who leaves and **never** returns. The
   server clears the slot's score before broadcasting the departure, so
   the final total survives only in the mod's `left the game with N frags`
   print or by rolling back the reset that shares the drop's timestamp;
   the match analyser does both. Residual gaps: a slot handed over without
   the wire ever changing its userid cannot be split, and a mod that
   neither prints the departure nor drops the client leaves nothing to
   recover from. See [mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md](mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md)
   (search "Departure") and
   [mvd-analytics/analyzer/match.md](mvd-analytics/analyzer/match.md).

4. **Same-tick item insta-regrab**: If an item respawns and is picked up
   again within a single server tick (camped spawn), the wire never
   emits a "visible" transition for that cycle. The items analyzer
   recovers these via two synthesis paths (KTX `//ktx took` hint-driven
   for armors/MH/weapons/powerups; stat-delta + position for small
   healths and ammo), so per-touch counts match KTX's authoritative
   `tooks` across the corpus. Two health boxes grabbed in one frame
   (a coalesced health jump) attribute to the gainer via per-box stat
   evidence. The one residual is two *same-magnitude* small healths
   (e.g. h15 + h15) contested in a single frame, which the health-jump
   signal can't tell apart. See
   [mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md#item-tracking-via-entity-state](mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md#item-tracking-via-entity-state)
   and [mvd-analytics/analyzer/items.md](mvd-analytics/analyzer/items.md#insta-regrab-synthesis).

5. **Weapon pickups from backpacks (SSG/SNG/GL/NG)**: KTX emits the
   `//ktx bp` backpack-pickup hint only for RL and LG packs, so
   super-shotgun / super-nailgun / nailgun / grenade-launcher grabs off
   a dropped pack have no authoritative wire signal. In non-weapon-stay
   modes (dmm1/dmm4) they are simply missing: per-weapon totals
   reconcile with KTX `weapons.<w>.pickups.spawn-taken` but fall short
   of `total-taken` by the backpack grabs (systemic; RL/LG reconcile
   fully). In weapon-stay modes (deathmatch 2/3/5, coop — dmm3
   duels/2on2 included), where world weapon pickups are synthesized
   from STAT_ITEMS flips, these pack grabs *do* surface — as
   `source: "unknown"` entries, since a bit flip away from any weapon
   pad can't be tied to a specific pack. See
   [mvd-analytics/README.md](mvd-analytics/README.md#weapon-pickups).

6. **Damage: raw (unbound) vs bounded families**: `result.Damage` is
   reconstructed from the KTX `mvdhidden_dmgdone` stream, which reports the
   **full** hit including overkill, capped only at 9999 (a telefrag reports
   9999) — the **raw** family. KTX's end-of-match scoreboard
   (`demoInfo.players[].dmg`) instead bounds each hit to the victim's
   remaining health; since schema v55 that **bounded** family is
   derived per hit from the death-value identity (a survived hit is exact
   by construction; a killing hit's overkill is measured by the death
   broadcast) and carried in additive `bounded` fields — `bounded` is the
   REST/MCP **default**, `raw`/`both` the opt-ins, and unfiltered bounded
   summaries substitute KTX's exact scoreboard figures
   (`boundedSource: "ktx"`). Residual approximation exists only where the
   wire hides state (the −99 corpse clamp, respawn-masked deaths,
   same-frame multi-hit cascades, pent/teamplay armor-share estimates);
   corpus-wide totals reconcile with `demoInfo` within pinned tolerances
   (max ±16 per player on given/taken). Godmode
   is unobservable, so a hit on a godmode holder is reconstructed as if it
   landed. The reconstruction is **skipped** on `k_midair` / `k_instagib` /
   `k_dmgfrags` demos (`damage.boundedMode = "skipped:<mode>"`) where the
   mode rewrites `T_Damage` unobservably; `dmg=bounded` there is a `422
   bounded_unavailable`. **Positional kills** — telefrags (the 9999
   instakill sentinel) and stomps (landing on a head) — are kept out of
   `events` / every per-weapon map / `matrix` / `ewep` / `totalDamage` and tracked
   separately (`damage.telefrags`/`damage.stomps`, the opt-in
   `telefrag`/`stomp` events), but their damage **folds into**
   `given`/`givenTeam`/`taken` in both families (mirroring KTX, which
   applies no tele/stomp exclusion to its scoreboard accumulation).
   Available only on KTX demos with the MVD-hidden extension; the `EWep`
   victim-weapon buckets additionally depend on reconstructing each
   victim's inventory from `STAT_ITEMS` updates.

7. **Wall-clock anchor resolution / availability**: `streams.global`'s
   `demoStartUnixMs` is millisecond-accurate (`demoStartAccuracyMs = 1`)
   only when the demo carries the mvdhidden `0x000B` block; otherwise it
   degrades to the whole-second serverinfo `epoch` cvar
   (`demoStartAccuracyMs = 1000`), and — on the ~73% of the archive that has
   neither — is back-shifted from a wire date marker by `demoOffset` (schema
   v72), which costs resolution: `demoStartAccuracyMs` becomes `50400000` when
   the marker named no timezone. `demoStartSource` says which case a result is
   in, and `matchStartConfidence` grades the marker; a *contradicted* marker is
   deliberately not back-shifted, so `demoStartUnixMs` can still be absent. ~5%
   of the archive carries no date signal at all. It anchors **demo open**, not
   match start — consumers add `demoOffset` to reach the match, or read
   `matchStartUnixMs`. Some 2026
   demos emit a `0x000B` block that is not a timestamp at all (a 1–2 byte
   non-wall-clock value); those are range-checked out and fall back to
   `epoch`. See [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md) and
   [mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md](mvd-reader/MVD_FORMAT.md#hidden-message-types).
   For **paused** demos the wall-clock mapping also needs
   `streams.global.pauses[]`: the durations come from the mvdhidden `0x000A`
   `paused_duration` block, which only current production mvdsv embeds in
   the .mvd (older servers wrote it to QTV streams only) and which is
   written with non-standard framing (no inner block-length header) — both
   are handled, but a demo from a server that doesn't embed it has no
   per-pause signal, so its wall-clock mapping drifts by the pause time.

8. **Floor height provisioning and edge cases**: the per-sample height
   above the floor (`streams.players[].pos.h`, schema v24) is traced
   through player clip hulls built from the map's BSP, via the same
   best-effort provisioning as the visibility-aware loc filter — the
   `h` column is absent for any map whose BSP isn't deployed (and for
   the handful of HL/Quake 2-format maps the BSP parser rejects). Since
   schema v26 the height is measured over the player's bounding-box
   footprint, so a player skimming a ledge or well rim — origin over
   the pit, box overhanging the rim — reads the near floor rather than
   the distant one far below. Since schema v27 the trace scene also
   poses every moving brush-model entity (the dm2 RA/quad lift,
   func_door, func_train) at its demo-streamed origin, so riders read
   ~0 instead of the static floor beneath the platform. Since schema
   v28 liquids participate as well: a per-sample liquid-state column
   (`pos.lq`, water/slime/lava × feet/waist/eyes) mirrors the engine's
   `PM_CategorizePosition`, submerged samples read `h = 0` by
   definition, and a jump over water measures to the water surface
   rather than the floor beneath it. Remaining caveat:
   func_illusionary is traced like any other inline brush model
   (the same approximation the client's prediction makes in
   `CL_SetSolidEntities`), so a player passing through one can briefly
   read it as a floor. See
   [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](mvd-analytics/RESULT_SCHEMA.md) (`PositionTrack.h`).
   Since **schema v31** each position sample also carries the player's
   **view direction** (`pos.vp` / `pos.vya`) — pitch and yaw as the raw
   `angle16` state, kept losslessly after `svc_playerinfo` delta
   carry-forward (decode `uint16(v)*360/65536`; pitch > 180° = looking
   up). Unlike floor height it needs no BSP — the angles ride the same
   `svc_playerinfo` samples as x/y/z. The view-layer
   query API and CLI expose position channels independently: `pos` is
   strictly x/y/z, with opt-in `view` / `hgt` / `lq` for look direction,
   floor height, and liquid state. Since **schema v32** there is also a
   derived per-sample **velocity** (`pos.vx`/`vy`/`vz`, Quake units/sec,
   opt-in `vel`), computed by a central-difference estimator that does
   not differentiate across respawns, teleporters, or time gaps. Since
   **schema v33** positions (x/y/z), velocity (vx/vy/vz), and floor
   height (h) are **`float32`** — the wire-native sub-unit origin, no
   longer truncated to whole units (which also sharpens the velocity);
   the `h` no-floor sentinel is now `-1000000000`.

9. **Aim target attribution (schema v41, refined v44)**: the `aim` block's
   crosshair error is computed against the player it attributes each shot
   to. A **hit** attributes to its server-confirmed victim (exact; nearest
   by crosshair error when a pellet fire hit several — can be a teammate on
   team damage, flagged per sample since v45). A **miss** has no confirmed
   target: in a **duel** the one enemy is exact (`mode: "duel"`); in a
   **team game** it is a heuristic — the live enemy nearest the crosshair
   at the fire time (`mode: "team"`), so a missed shot tracking one
   opponent while another crosses closer to the crosshair can be
   mis-attributed. Misses are only attributed to an enemy whose position
   track brackets the fire time and who is alive at it. The rocket
   "direct hit" count is likewise a heuristic (non-splash damage events ≈
   direct contacts). These are labeled in the data so consumers can
   disambiguate. Hit counts include team and self hits (server parity) —
   the v45 `victimKinds` / per-bucket splits let consumers separate them
   (a rocket jump is a self hit, not an enemy hit).

9b. **Accuracy on old demos is a second, separately-named tier (schema
   v73).** Demos with no KTX damage stream have no wire hit to link a
   fire to, so `aim.hitsMeasured` is false there and every measured hit
   counter is withheld (schema v71) — that has not changed. What is new
   is that the RECONSTRUCTED damage log is now joined back to the fires,
   and the recovered count published as `weapons[].recon.hits`, with
   `aim.hitsSource` naming the evidence (`ktx` / `reconstructed` /
   absent). The two tiers live in different fields and are never merged,
   so a reconstructed count cannot be mistaken for a measured one. It
   covers `lg`/`sg`/`ssg`/`axe` — the weapons whose damage lands in the
   fire's own server frame, where the join measured 0.3–1.7 percentage
   points of accuracy error against the wire-linked counter — and
   deliberately NOT `rl`/`gl`/`ng`/`sng`, whose fire→impact link needs a
   projectile-flight bracket that a finished Result does not carry.
   Everything below the hit COUNT stays withheld on those demos too: no
   per-fire hit flags, no pellet split, no direct/splash, no LG whiff
   classes, no enemy/team/self slices. Method and per-weapon tables:
